iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> presenting the <span
class="smcap">Memorials of Knightsbridge</span> to the public,
apology must be made for the delay in its appearance since the
announcement of its intended publication.&nbsp; This was
occasioned by the sudden and protracted illness of its Editor:
since his restoration, he has prosecuted the work with all the
diligence which his time permitted.</p>
<p>The book is published in the hope that its critics may treat
its Author kindly, since the brain that indited it is, alas! no
more.&nbsp; It is the result of great assiduity and perseverance
amidst peculiar difficulties, and was only completed just before
the death of the compiler, who, towards its close, had laboured
at it with greater energy than his weakened frame ought properly
to have borne.</p>
<p>The immediate motive for publication was the Editor&rsquo;s
regard, it might almost be termed veneration, for its writer,
seconded by favourable opinions expressed by several literary
gentlemen who perused the manuscript, and knowledge that many
notices by the same hand had already appeared in &ldquo;Notes and
Queries,&rdquo; &ldquo;The West Middlesex Advertiser,&rdquo; and
the various local papers that have occasionally been published in
the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The work was written from notes made at various times, some
having been taken when its author was yet a boy.&nbsp; It may
therefore be described as the labour of his short and painful
life; and it was felt that so long as the result <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>of his
application was laid aside, so long did the Editor&rsquo;s duty
to his brother remain unperformed.</p>
<p>As some little notice of our historian may be desirable, the
following sketch is subjoined:&mdash;</p>
<p>Henry George Davis was born at 4, Mill&rsquo;s Buildings, on
August 14th, 1830.&nbsp; While an infant he had severe
inflammation of the lungs, which afterwards became confirmed
pleurisy.&nbsp; He was educated at the Philological School in the
New Road.&nbsp; Of this Institution he was to the last fond and
proud.&nbsp; Having carried off many of its prizes, he always
felt an identity with it.&nbsp; He was of a studious
inclination&mdash;a disposition doubtless fostered by his
infirmities; for he was never able to join in the sports of his
fellows.&nbsp; As he arrived at manhood, his disease (increased
in 1850 by rheumatic fever) became much more severe, and finally
released his soul &ldquo;to its Almighty source&rdquo; on the
30th of December, 1857.</p>
<p>The Editor has to acknowledge obligations to O. B. Cole, Esq.;
to the author of &ldquo;Paddington, Past and Present;&rdquo; to
the Rev. M. Walcot, of &ldquo;The Memorials of
Westminster;&rdquo; Mr. Cunningham, of &ldquo;The Handbook of
London;&rdquo; Mr. Faulkner&rsquo;s works; and to those sundry
publications the name of which is given with each
quotation.&nbsp; He hopes his readers may have that enjoyment in
the perusal of the following History which was had in the
providing of it for them.</p>

unwritten.&nbsp; This neglect, perhaps, is owing to the fact that
neither place, till of late, assumed sufficient importance to
attract the topographical writer; nevertheless, I trust the
following pages will show that Knightsbridge is far from
destitute of associations deserving to be recovered and saved
from the ravages of time.</p>
<p>The derivation of its name is somewhat obscure: the earliest
mention of the place I am acquainted with occurs in a charter of
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Edward the
Confessor, in which it is called <span
class="smcap">Kyngesbyrig</span>; in one of Abbot Herbert of
Westminster, nearly a century later, it is spelt <span
class="smcap">Knyghtsbrigg</span>.&nbsp; It is similarly written
in the thirty-fifth year of the reign of Edward III.&nbsp; The
difficulty lies in the transposition from
&ldquo;Kyngesbyrig&rdquo; to &ldquo;Knyghtsbrigg.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The former sufficiently indicates its origin; and to avoid
perplexity tradition comes opportunely to our aid, to point out
the latent allusion in the latter.</p>
<p>Knightsbridge, of course, must have its legend.&nbsp; No place
in the kingdom exists but must have some story to tell; and if it
cannot show a castle built by C&aelig;sar, and battered down by
Cromwell, recourse must be had elsewhere for such.&nbsp; Well,
then, our legend tells, that in some ancient time certain knights
had occasion to go from London to wage war for some holy purpose:
light in heart, if heavy in arms, they passed through
Knightsbridge on their way to receive the blessing awarded to the
faithful by the Bishop at Fulham.&nbsp; From some cause, however,
a quarrel ensued between two of the band, and a combat was
determined on to decide the dispute.&nbsp; They fought on the <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>bridge which
spanned the stream, while from its banks the struggle was watched
by their partisans.&nbsp; Both, the legend tells, fell; and ever
after the place was called <span
class="smcap">Knightsbridge</span>, in remembrance of their fatal
feud.</p>
<p>If this old story, which I many times have heard related, has
tempted us into the realms of fancy for awhile, another
derivation of a totally opposite kind will speedily drive us
therefrom; according to this, the name comes from the word
&ldquo;Neat,&rdquo; signifying cattle, and refers to a time when
beasts for the London citizens were ordered to be slain here.</p>
<p>And, again, a commentator of Norden, the topographer, gives
the following anecdote, which it has been thought may account for
the name:&mdash;&ldquo;Kingesbridge, commonly called Stonebridge,
near Hyde Park Corner, where I wish no true man to walk too late
without good guard, as did Sir H. Knyvett, Knight, who valiantly
defended himself, there being assaulted, and slew the
master-thief with his own hands.&rdquo; <a
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3"
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
<p>Against these two proposed derivations, however, it must be
answered that the place was <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>called &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Knyghtsbrigg</span>&rdquo; in Herbert&rsquo;s
charter long before the time to which either of these
circumstances apply.&nbsp; Edward the Confessor owned lands here,
and probably built a bridge for the convenience of those monks to
whom he devised a part of them; hence the name <span
class="smcap">Kingsbridge</span>.&nbsp; Having nothing recorded
whereby we can account for the change to <span
class="smcap">Knightsbridge</span>, we can only surmise that it
was caused by corruption of the name, or that there may be some
foundation, other than the story of the brave Knyvett, for the
legend I have related.</p>
<h3>THE MANOR AND PAROCHIAL DIVISIONS.</h3>
<p>The land constituting this district appears to have belonged
originally to King Edward the Confessor.&nbsp; There is, in the
British Museum, a charter still preserved, a translation of which
was printed by Mr. Faulkner, in which, giving to the church at
Westminster the manor of Cealchyth (Chelsea), with various
emoluments and privileges, the charter
proceeds&mdash;&ldquo;Besides, together with this manor, every
third tree, and every horse load of fruits, grown in the
neighbouring <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>wood at <span class="smcap">Kyngesbyrig</span>, which, as
in ancient times, was confirmed by law.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the
earliest mention of Knightsbridge recorded; the land referred to
is now occupied by Lowndes-square and its neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Knightsbridge is not mentioned in Doomsday Book, neither is
Westbourn, Hyde, nor Paddington; and it is most likely that the
returns for these places are given with the surrounding manors of
Eia, Chelchith, Lilestone, &amp;c.&nbsp; Eia was confirmed to the
Abbey of Westminster by William the Conqueror, and included the
land between the Tyburn on the east, the Westbourn on the west,
the great military road (Oxford-street) on the north, and the
Thames on the south.&nbsp; Yet, although given thus early to the
Abbey, it was not included in the franchise of the city of
Westminster, notwithstanding Knightsbridge, which chiefly lay
beyond it, was so included; for, in 1222, a dispute having arisen
between the Bishop of London and the Abbot of Westminster,
respecting their ecclesiastical jurisdiction, it was referred to
Stephen Langton, Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops of
Winchester and Salisbury, and the Priors of Merton and Dunstable;
and they <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>decided that the Tyburn stream was the limit of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s parish westward; adding, however, that,
&ldquo;beyond these bounds the districts of Knightsbridge,
Westbourn, Padyngton with its chapel, and their appurtenances,
belong to the parish of St. Margaret aforesaid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Part
of Knightsbridge still belongs to St. Margaret&rsquo;s, and it is
most probable that some great proprietor living in that parish
owned lands here, and hence, in old assessments, such became to
be reckoned component parts of the parish.</p>
<p>In the Confessor&rsquo;s charter the mention of &ldquo;the
wood at Kyngesbyrig&rdquo; gives, I consider, an index to what
the state of the place was then.&nbsp; It doubtless formed a
portion of the great forest which Fitzstephen describes as
belting the metropolis.&nbsp; It owned no lord, and the few
inhabitants enjoyed free chase and other rights in it.&nbsp; In
1218 it was disafforested by order of Henry III., whom we
afterwards find owned lands here; and in the reign of his son,
Edward I., Knightsbridge, according to Lysons, is mentioned as a
manor of the Abbey.</p>
<p>The monks of Westminster gradually acquired other lands here,
additional to those granted by the Confessor.&nbsp; At Westbourn
also <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>they
had lands, as the decree of 1222 proves; how possession of them
was gained is not, however, known.&nbsp; These properties the
monks erected into a manor, called &ldquo;The Manor of <span
class="smcap">Knightsbridge</span> and <span
class="smcap">Westbourn</span>;&rdquo; and by such name it is
still known.&nbsp; The whole of the isolated part of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s, including a part of Kensington, its palace and
gardens, are included in the manor of Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>That there was a suspicion of the integrity of the
monks&rsquo; proceedings, however, we have proof in the fact
that, in the twenty-second year of the reign of Edward I.
(1294&ndash;5), a writ of <i>Quo Warranto</i> was issued to Abbot
Walter of Wenlock, to inquire &ldquo;by what authority he claimed
to hold the Pleas of the Crown, to have free warren, a market, a
fair, toll, a gallows, the chattels of persons condemned, and of
runaways, the right of imprisonment,&rdquo; and various other
similar privileges, as well as &ldquo;the appointment of coroner
in Eye, Knythbrigg, Chelcheheth, Braynford, Padyngton, Hamstede,
and Westburn,&rdquo; &amp;c.; to which he answered, that these
places were &ldquo;members&rdquo; of the town of Westminster, and
that King Henry III. had granted to God and the church <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of St. Peter of
Westminster, and the monks therein, all his tenements, and had
commanded that they hold them with all their liberties and free
customs, &amp;c.; and he produced the charter proving the
same.</p>
<p>Such was the reply of Abbot Walter of Wenlock, who appears,
however, to have been by no means over chary of the ways by which
he could bring wealth to his abbey; for we find that, in the
twelfth year of Edward II., his successor, Richard de Kedyngton,
was fined ten pounds because he (Abbot Walter) had appropriated
lay fees in Knythbrigg, Padyngton, Eye, and Westbourne, without
licence of the king.&nbsp; We also find that in the same reign
two inquisitions were held to ascertain what, if any, injury the
king would sustain if certain properties were allowed the
Abbey:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Inquisitio ad

105.<br />
<span class="smcap">Middlesex</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Inquisition made before the Escheator of
the Lord the King at the church of St. Mary Atte Stronde, on
Thursday next, after the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed
Mary, in the ninth year of the reign of King Edward, by the Oath
of Robert de Aldenham, Alexander <a name="page9"></a><span

de la Hyde, Walter Fraunceis, William de Padinton, Hugh le
Arderne, William Est, Arnold le Frutier, Simon le Brewere, Roger
de Malthous, and Roger le Marshall, junior&mdash;who say, upon
their oath, that Walter de Wenlock, lately Abbot of Westminster,
had acquired to himself and his House one messuage with
appurtenances in Knygthebregge of William le Smyth of
Knygthebregge, and four acres of land there of William Brisel and
Asseline his wife, and nine acres of land there of William Hond,
and twelve acres of land in Padinton of William de Padington, and
three and a-half acres in Eye of Hugh le Bakere of Eye, and
thirteen acres of land in Westbourn of John le Taillour, and
eleven acres of land there of Matilda Arnold, and two acres of
land there of Juliana Baysebolle, after the publication of the
statute edited concerning the nonplacing of lands in Mortmain and
not before.&nbsp; And they say that it is not to the damage nor
prejudice of the Lord the King, nor of others, if the King grant
to the Prior and Convent of Westminster, that the Abbots of that
place, for the time being, may recover and hold the aforesaid <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>messuages and
land to them and their successors for ever.&nbsp; And they say
that the aforesaid messuage is held of the said Abbot and Convent
by service of a yearly rent of sixpence, and of performing suit
at the Court of the said Abbot and Convent, and of finding one
man for ten half-days to mow the Lord&rsquo;s meadow, price
fifteen-pence; and one man for ten half-days to hoe the
Lord&rsquo;s corn, price tenpence; and of doing seven ploughings,
price three shillings and sixpence; and of finding one man for
ten half-days to reap the Lord&rsquo;s corn, price fifteen-pence;
and of making seven carriages to carry the Lord&rsquo;s hay,
price three shillings and sixpence; and performing suit at the
Court of the said Abbot from three weeks to three weeks.&nbsp;
And they say that the aforesaid fifty-four acres and a-half of
land are worth by the year, in all issues over and above the
aforesaid services, nineteen shillings and sixpence.&nbsp; In
witness of which thing the aforesaid jurors have set their seals
to this inquisition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Endorsed twenty shillings and sixpence. <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p>This sum due to the king and paid to him, shows that he still
retained some right or other <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>over the lands mentioned.&nbsp; But
this inquest does not seem to have given satisfaction to all, for
three years after, another was held before the king&rsquo;s
escheator and a jury, concerning the same lands; the return was,
however, in the main similar to that of the first inquiry, a fine
of ten pounds being thereupon paid to the king.</p>
<p>But as early as the reign of Henry I. some lands at
Knightsbridge belonging to the Abbey had been aliened from
it&mdash;one Godwin, a hermit at Kilburn, having given his
hermitage there to three nuns; Abbot Herbert not only confirmed
the grant, but augmented it with lands at Cnightebriga, <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a> and a rent of thirty shillings.&nbsp;
The charter states the land to be granted with the consent of the
whole &ldquo;chapter and council,&rdquo; to the holy virgins of
St. John the Baptist, at Kilburn, for the repose of the soul of
King Edward, founder of the Abbey, &ldquo;and for the souls of
all their brethren and benefactors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next mention of this place occurs in a record dated 1270
(54 Henry III.), when an <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>inquisition was held to ascertain
whether two acres of land, &amp;c., at &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Kingesgor</span> between Knytesbrigg and
Kensington&rdquo; were of the ancient demesne of the Crown or of
escheat, its extent, value, &amp;c.&nbsp; The jury returned that
the land was of the ancient demesne of the Crown, and not of
escheat, that it contained three acres, of which the Sheriffs of
Middlesex had received the issues, and was worth by the acre
twelve-pence per annum, and that such land belonged to the farm
of the city of London.</p>
<p>Part of the Hamlet of Knightsbridge was within the manor of
Eia, the boundaries of which I have described.&nbsp; It included,
with others, all the lands now forming the parish of St. George,
Hanover-square, and was given to the Abbey, in 1102, by Geoffry
de Mandeville, in consideration of the privilege allowed him of
the burial of his wife Athelais in the cloisters of the
Abbey.&nbsp; In Doomsday Book it answers for ten hides, but was
afterwards divided into the three manors of Neyte, Eybury, and
Hyde.&nbsp; Neyte is mentioned as early as 1342 in a commission
of sewers, and was near the Thames; Hyde, with lands taken from
Knightsbridge, afterwards formed Hyde Park.&nbsp; All these <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>manors were
enjoyed by the Abbey till the Reformation, and at that tremendous
crisis they reverted to the king.</p>
<p>In the account rendered to the king by the ministers appointed
to receive the revenues of the religious houses on their
dissolution, the value of the manor of Knightsbridge and
Westbourn is thus given:&mdash;</p>

<p>Kilburn Priory was returned as of the value of seventy-four
pounds, seven shillings, and eleven-pence; and by the provisions
of 27 Henry VIII., chap. 28, all its possessions went to the
king.&nbsp; By an act passed in the next session (28 Henry VIII.,
c. 38) its lands were exchanged by the king with Sir William
Weston, Prior of the Hospital of St. John of <a

<p>Notwithstanding the Reformation, Knightsbridge was still
reserved to the Abbey, and in the hands of its deans and chapters
it has ever since remained, excepting during the alienation of
church lands in the seventeenth century, when it became the
property of Sir George Stonehouse.&nbsp; The lands at the Gore,
and near to it, passed into various lay hands, and will be
hereafter more fully noticed.</p>
<p>The manor of Eybury also passed into lay hands.&nbsp; In the
Act 28, Henry VIII. c. 49, it is stated as lately in the
occupation of Richard Whashe; and a person of that name rented
the more considerable part of it known as Ebury <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Farm in 1592,
direct from Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; Other portions of the manor
were similarly rented by persons who underlet the land again,
thereby occasioning great wrong to the inhabitants at
large&mdash;for notwithstanding the great length of time these
lands had been in priestly possession, the people, in some
measure, appear to have maintained a claim over them, and
considerable portions were always laid open for use in common at
Lammas-tide (Aug. 1).&nbsp; This ancient right these lessees
under the Queen appear to have been determined to resist, and
enclosed the fields with gates and hedges, on which the
inhabitants appealed, in 1592, to Lord Burleigh, High Steward of
Westminster, for his interference in their behalf.&nbsp; He
ordered Mr. Tenche, his under-steward, to empanel an inquest; and
the decision of the jury being favourable to the petitioners,
they, thinking they should have Lord Burleigh&rsquo;s
countenance, proceeded on Lammas-day to assert their
rights.&nbsp; The gates were pulled down, and the fences cut
away, on which the tenants appealed on their part to Burleigh,
who, again referring the matter to Mr. Tenche, that functionary,
after inquiry, replied, that &ldquo;certain of the parishioners
of <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>St.
Martin&rsquo;s and St. Margaret&rsquo;s assembled
together,&rdquo; and made an entry into their &ldquo;ancient
commons&rdquo; by making &ldquo;a small breach in every
enclosure;&rdquo; that some of those assembled &ldquo;were of the
best and ancientest of the parishes; that they carried no weapon,
and had only four or five shovels and pickaxes, and had divers
constables with them to keep her Majesty&rsquo;s peace;&rdquo;
and that &ldquo;having thus laid open such grounds as they
challenged to be their commons, they quietly retired to their
houses, without any further hurt-doing.&rdquo;&nbsp; One Peter
Dod, in his evidence before the inquest, said &ldquo;they told
him they would break open to Knight&rsquo;s Bridge and
Chelsey;&rdquo; and R. Wood, a constable, testified to the
breaking of the enclosure at &ldquo;Aubery Farm towards
Chelsey,&rdquo; whence they crossed to &ldquo;Crowfield,&rdquo;
at the upper end of Hyde-park.</p>
<p>Her Majesty&rsquo;s &ldquo;poor tenants and farmours&rdquo;
petitioned Lord Burleigh to commit some of the parishioners to
the Star Chamber, and to stop further proceedings until the case
could be heard in the Court of Exchequer.&nbsp; The inhabitants
rejoined, stating &ldquo;that Ebury Farm, containing 430 acres,
meadow and pasture, which was <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>holden of her Majesty by lease, was
granted to one Whashe, who paid &pound;21 per annum.&nbsp; And
the same was let to divers persons, who for their private
commodity did inclose the same, and had made pastures of arable
land; thereby not only annoying her Majesty in her walks and
passages, but to the <i>hindrance of her game</i>, and great
injury to the common, which at Lammas was wont to be laid open,
for the most part, as by ancient precedents thereof made, do more
particularly appear.&rdquo;&nbsp; They then state this system of
inclosure had prevailed for about twenty years; that in the
Neate, there were 108 acres belonging to her Majesty similarly
enclosed, although they should also be common at Lammas.&nbsp;
Strype, from whom this account is derived, does not state how the
contest terminated; but certain it is that for very many years
the owners of some of these lands paid money to the parish
officers of St. Martin&rsquo;s, in lieu of this claim; but I
cannot find that this right of the poor has at all for many years
been inquired into.&nbsp; Parochial officers have, in many
instances, sadly neglected their duty; and this is not one of the
lightest accusations against them.</p>
<p>The manor of Ebury afterwards became the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>property of a
family named Davis, who owned it for a lengthened period.&nbsp;
The last male of this family, Alexander Davis, died July 2nd,
1665; by his wife, Mary, daughter of Richard Dukeson, D.D., and
who survived till July 11th, 1717, <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a> he had one daughter,
Mary, who was married at St. Clement&rsquo;s Danes, October 10th,
1676, to Sir Thomas Grosvenor.&nbsp; This manor devolved upon
her; and on her death, January 12th, 1730, came to be the
freehold property of her husband, whose descendant has been
ennobled by the title of Marquis of Westminster, and is the
present Lord of the Manor of Ebury.</p>
<p>We will now revert to Knightsbridge proper again.&nbsp; It
anciently occupied a great deal more land than its present
appearance indicates.&nbsp; In the reign of Elizabeth certain
lands appertaining to the park were within it.&nbsp; An indenture
to that effect, dated July 6th, in the eleventh year of the
Queen&rsquo;s reign, between the Marquis of Winchester, Lord High
Treasurer, and Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer,
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>on behalf
of the Queen, and Francis Nevyll, one of the keepers of
Hyde-park, on his own behalf, was agreed to for the better
preservation of the game; and it was ordered that
&ldquo;our&rdquo; land, called Knightsbridge land, containing, by
estimation, about forty acres, should, at the costs of her
Majesty, be &ldquo;rayled&rdquo; in, to hinder all manner of
horses and cattle (except her Majesty&rsquo;s &ldquo;dere&rdquo;)
entering the said enclosed land.&nbsp; The said Francis Nevyll
then covenants that while he is keeper he will keep the gates
thereof locked, and will not suffer any horses or cattle to be
put therein.&nbsp; He also agrees to make and sell in stacks, or
carry into her Majesty&rsquo;s hay-barn, all the hay which may be
made within the said &ldquo;rayled&rdquo; lands, and deliver the
same to &ldquo;her Grace&rsquo;s dere&rdquo; in winter, and shall
not in the wintry half-year put to pasture within the said
&ldquo;rayled&rdquo; land above the number of ten kine or
bullocks, or in lieu of every two kine or bullocks, one horse or
gelding.&nbsp; Another plot of ground, belonging to the
Lazar-house, was also enclosed within Hyde-park; but of its
extent, or why the institution should have been deprived of it, I
have not been able to ascertain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Bridge</span>.&mdash;The bridge,
whence the place <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>derives its name, we are informed by Strype, was a stone
bridge, and most probably the one he described was the same as
remained to our own time.&nbsp; When, or by whom, first erected,
is not recorded; but it is not improbable that the saintly king
who first gave the monks possessions here, to render such more
available, would throw a bridge across the stream.&nbsp; For by
this road even then was the only way to the metropolis from the
west, and the stream was both broad and rapid.&nbsp; It was
situated between the last house of Knightsbridge-terrace (Mr.
Jeffrey&rsquo;s), and the French Embassy, and a part of it yet
exists under the road; a portion of it was removed for the
Albert-gate improvements.&nbsp; In the churchwardens&rsquo;
accounts of St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster, are the following
entries regarding it:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Westbourn</span>.&mdash;The Westbourn,
for such was the ancient name of the rivulet which ran <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>through
Knightsbridge, was one of the numerous streams which flowed from
the range of Hampstead and Highgate to the Thames.&nbsp; Its name
is derived from its being most westerly of those streams in or by
the metropolis.&nbsp; Rising at West End, Hampstead, and running
towards Bayswater, it passed through it, behind St. James&rsquo;s
Church; here it crossed the Uxbridge-road, and entering
Kensington-gardens, passed through them and Hyde-park, where its
silver thread ran along the centre of the Serpentine, into which
it entered, and by the addition of several ponds, it was widened
in 1731.&nbsp; Leaving the park, it crossed the Great
Western-road at Albert-gate, thence it passed in an oblique line
behind the east side of William-street and Lowndes-square, behind
Lowndes-street and Chesham-street, and bending to the right,
passed under Grosvenor-bridge, where it divided and emptied
itself into old Father Thames by two mouths.&nbsp; The eastern
course was stopped up when the Grosvenor Canal was formed, but
the mouth may still be distinctly traced at the back of
Westmoreland-street.&nbsp; The western mouth is the entrance to
the Ranelagh sewer, to which the stream has <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>for many
years degenerated.&nbsp; By an under current, formed in 1834, its
course was diverted at Bayswater, to prevent drainage passing
into the Serpentine; and when the Five Fields were intended to be
built on, a new sewer, for which Smeaton had previously made
surveys, was constructed.&nbsp; The whole of its course is now
covered in, although part of it was open so late as 1854.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Westbourn was occasionally a source of annoyance to the
inhabitants of Knightsbridge.&nbsp; After heavy rains it
overflowed; on September 1st, 1768, it did so, and caused great
damage, almost undermining some of the neighbouring houses; and
in January, 1809, it overflowed again, and covered the
neighbouring fields so deeply, that they bore the appearance of a
lake, and passengers were for several days rowed from Chelsea to
Westminster by Thames boatmen.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Olden Time</span>.&mdash;It would
appear from the warning of the chronicler, &ldquo;not to walk too
late without good guard,&rdquo; that our locality bore formerly
rather a bad name.&nbsp; And I fear I must admit that it did so,
though, perhaps, not more dangerous than any other of the chief
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>highways
to the metropolis.&nbsp; The Great Western Road ran through the
hamlet, which bore a good proportion of inns, the proprietors of
which would appear to have rather connived at the iniquities
practised, and thus rendered the action of the law more
difficult.</p>
<p>In 1380, Richard II., by his letters patent, dated March 2nd,
granted to John Croucher, of Knightsbridge, towards the repairing
of the king&rsquo;s highway from London to Brentford, customs of
the several vendible commodities therein mentioned (those of
ecclesiastical men, and their proper goods bought for their use,
excepted), to be taken at Knightsbridge and elsewhere, as he
shall think expedient, for three years next ensuing.&nbsp; In
1382 this was renewed, and in 1386 was granted to John Croucher
and Lawrence Newport. <a name="citation24"></a><a
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a>&nbsp; But,
notwithstanding this early care of the road, it does not appear
to have been always followed up, for Wyatt&rsquo;s men entered
London, in 1554, by this road; its state materially aided in
their discomfiture, and so great was the delay occasioned that
the Queen&rsquo;s party were able to make every preparation; and
when ultimately they reached London <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>their jaded appearance gained them
the name of &ldquo;draggletails.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would appear
from the extracts quoted from the St. Margaret&rsquo;s accounts
that the law was applied to the parish for its neglect in this
respect, and in 1724 a petition was presented to the House of
Commons, praying for an Act to remedy the evil.&nbsp; Twelve
years later, when the Court had resided at Kensington for nearly
fifty years, we find Lord Hervey writing to his mother that,
&ldquo;the road between this place (Kensington) and London is
grown so infamously bad, that we live here in the same solitude
as we should do if cast on a rock in the middle of the ocean, and
all the Londoners tell us there is between them and us a great
impassable gulf of mud.&nbsp; There are two roads through the
park, but the new one is so convex, and the old one so concave,
that by this extreme of faults they agree in the common one of
being, <i>like the high road</i>, <i>impassable</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a></p>
<p>Mud and dust did not, however, form the greatest
unpleasantnesses of the road.&nbsp; In <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the Kensington register of burials
there is an entry telling of its terrible condition:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>25th November, 1687.&nbsp; Thomas Ridge, of
Portsmouth, who was killed by thieves, almost at
Knightsbridge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Lady Cowper, in her diary quoted by Lord Campbell, <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a> writes, in October, 1715, &ldquo;I was
at Kensington, where I intended to stay as long as the camp was
in Hyde-park, <i>the roads being so secure by it</i>, that we
might come from London at <i>any time of the night without
danger</i>, which I did very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult to understand the cool audacity of some of the
attacks on this road.&nbsp; The <i>Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, April, 1740, records that &ldquo;the Bristol mail
from London was robbed a little beyond Knightsbridge by a <i>man
on foot</i>, who took the Bath and Bristol bags, and, <i>mounting
the post-boy&rsquo;s horse</i>, rode off toward
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the 1st of July, 1774, William Hawke was
executed for a highway robbery here, and two men were executed on
the 30th of the ensuing November for a similar <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>offence. <a
name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a>&nbsp; Even so late as 1799, it was
necessary to order a party of light horse to patrol every night
from Hyde Park Corner to Kensington; <a name="citation27b"></a><a
href="#footnote27b" class="citation">[27b]</a> and it is within
the memory of many when pedestrians walked to and from Kensington
in bands sufficient to ensure mutual protection, starting at
known intervals, of which a bell gave due warning.</p>
<p>Respecting the innkeepers, the well-known Sheffield, Duke of
Buckingham, in his Memoirs, tells the following curious
story:&mdash;&ldquo;I was informed that the Earl of Rochester,
the wit, had said something of me which, according to his custom,
was very malicious; I therefore sent Colonel Aston, a very
mettled friend of mine, to call him to account for it.&nbsp; He
denied the words, and, indeed, I was soon convinced he had never
said them; but the mere report, though I found it to be false,
obliged me (as I then foolishly thought) to go on with the
quarrel; and the next day was appointed for <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>us to fight
on horseback, a way in England a little unusual, but it was his
part to choose.&nbsp; Accordingly I and my second lay the night
before at Knightsbridge privately, to avoid the being secured at
London upon any suspicion; which yet we found ourselves more in
danger of there, because we had all the appearance of highwaymen,
that had a mind to be skulking in an old inn for one night; but
this, I suppose, the people of the house <i>were used to</i>, and
so <i>took no notice of us</i>, <i>but liked us the
better</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in the &ldquo;Rehearsal,&rdquo;
written in ridicule of Dryden, we also have an allusion to the
innkeepers&rsquo; habits and
characters:&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Smith</i>: But pray, Mr. Bayes, is
not this a little difficult, that you were saying e&rsquo;en now,
to keep an army thus conceal&rsquo;d in
<i>Knights-Bridge</i>?&mdash;<i>Bayes</i>: In
<i>Knights-Bridge</i>?&nbsp; Stay.&mdash;<i>Johnson</i>: No, not
if the <i>inn-keepers be his friends</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Until the age of railways set in, these inns did a brisk trade
with the numerous travellers from the western parts.&nbsp; One of
the occurrences of the day was to watch the mails set off for
their destinations; there were above twenty at one time, besides
stage-coaches.&nbsp; Now there is but one of the latter kind,
which still, every <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>other day, goes to Brighton.&nbsp; Moore mentions in his
Diary waiting at Knightsbridge for his Bessie, coming to town by
the Bath coach.&nbsp; All now is altered&mdash;highwaymen,
patrols, and mails are all gone&mdash;and the road is the best
entrance into the capital.&nbsp; An Act, passed June 19th, 1829,
placed the Great Western Road, from Knightsbridge to Brentford
Bridge, under the charge of the Commissioners of Metropolitan
Roads.</p>
<p>It was a long time before our hamlet became part and parcel of
the metropolis.&nbsp; A letter in my possession, written by an
intelligent mechanic, fresh from Gloucester, and dated August,
1783, describes it as &ldquo;quite out of London, for
which,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I like it the better.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so it was; the stream then ran open, the streets were unpaved
and unlighted, and a maypole was still on the village
green.&nbsp; It is not ten years since the hawthorn hedge has
entirely disappeared at the Gore, and the blackbird and starling
might still be heard.&nbsp; We have seen the references to game
in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, but few persons imagine, perhaps, that
within the recollection of some who have not passed long from us,
snipe and <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>woodcocks might occasionally be lowered; now, however,
we are limited to our saucy friend the sparrow, for even the very
swallows have quitted us.</p>
<p>Forty years since, there was neither draper&rsquo;s nor
butcher&rsquo;s shop between Hyde Park Corner and Sloane Street,
and only one in the whole locality where a newspaper could be
had, or writing paper purchased.&nbsp; There was no conveyance to
London but by a kind of stagecoach; the roads were dimly lighted
by oil, <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a> and the modern paving only to be seen
along Knightsbridge Terrace.</p>
<p>Till about 1835, a watch-house and pound remained at the east
end of Middle Row; and the stocks were to be seen at the end of
Park-side, almost opposite the Conduit, as late as 1805.&nbsp; A
magistrate sat once a week at the Fox and Bull, and a market was
held every Thursday.</p>
<p>The water supply was anciently by means of springs and wells,
which were very pure, numerous, and valuable.&nbsp; In the
beginning of the eighteenth century, Park-side was leased from
the Dean and Chapter of Westminster by <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the Birkheads, and the few houses
then there were supplied by a conduit they were permitted by the
Crown to use, within Hyde Park.&nbsp; There was a row of conduits
in the fields each side of Rotten Row, whose waters were received
by the one at the end of Park-side, known as St. James&rsquo;s,
or the Receiving Conduit; and which supplied the royal residences
and the Abbey with water. <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; There were
several excellent springs also in the hamlet, one of which
appears to have been public property, from a story told by
Malcolm, to the effect that in 1727, there being an excessive
drought, the supply of water was rendered very precarious, and
disputes arose between the inhabitants of Knightsbridge as to
whom it belonged.&nbsp; The women appear to have taken an unusual
share in this quarrel, which was so fiercely carried on, that
requisition was had to a magistrate to hinder the tongue giving
way to the hands and nails.&nbsp; The magistrate decided that the
water belonged to the St. Margaret&rsquo;s part of the
hamlet.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS.</span></h2>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;Thus I entertain<br />

Beguiling harmlessly the listless hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Wordsworth</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> small a place as our hamlet
formerly was, it could not have many historical associations of
which to boast, and this chapter must, therefore, be brief.&nbsp;
Too small and unimportant to be the scene of great contests, or
of political intrigues, few notices of it in connection with
history occur, but those few are far from being
uninteresting.</p>
<p>In the year 1361, a dreadful plague broke out in France, and
fears were entertained that it might ravage London.&nbsp; To
prevent this, great precautions were taken, and the King promptly
issued an order, in which, reciting the evils which were
occasioned by the offal and refuse being thrown by the city
butchers <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>into the Thames, he ordered, on February 25, with the
consent of Parliament then assembled, that to provide &ldquo;for
the honesty of the said city, and the safety of the
people,&rdquo; all &ldquo;bulls, oxen, hogs, and other gross
creatures,&rdquo; to be slain for the citizens, should be led
either to Stratford on the one side, or Knightsbridge on the
other, and be there slain and dressed ready for sale.&nbsp; And
any butcher offending by killing within these places should be
imprisoned one year: a piece of legislative wisdom our own times
should imitate.</p>
<p>When the Kentish insurrection under Wyatt broke out against
the marriage of Mary and Philip of Spain, Wyatt having vainly
endeavoured to enter London by the bridge, was compelled to march
to Kingston, in order to cross the Thames; arriving at
Knightsbridge, he there rested his men &ldquo;untyll daye,&rdquo;
they &ldquo;being very weary with travel of that night and the
daye before.&rdquo;&nbsp; In London, the quaint old chronicler
tells us, &ldquo;there was no small adowe,&rdquo; and by nine
o&rsquo;clock on the morning of February 7, 1556, Wyatt set his
men in motion, and &ldquo;planting his ordenance upon the hill,
almost over agaynst the park corner,&rdquo; left it <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>there under a
guard, and marched towards Charing Cross.&nbsp; The Earl of
Pembroke, who commanded Mary&rsquo;s troops, hovered about
&ldquo;untyll all was passed by, saving the tayle,&rdquo; which
he cut off from the main body.&nbsp; This misfortune ruined
Wyatt, who soon after was captured, and ultimately executed; his
head being set up on Hay Hill, not far from the spot where he had
left his cannon.</p>
<p>During the contest between Charles I. and his people, many
skirmishes are traditionally said to have occurred here.&nbsp;
Although in the numerous works of all kinds I have referred to,
no mention could be found of such; yet that they did take place,
many remains of that period, since brought to light,
testify.&nbsp; Mr. Faulkner records the discovery of a helmet,
breastplate, and some swords, on the site of Lowndes
Square.&nbsp; In 1840, many human remains, coins of
Charles&rsquo; time, some curious horse-shoes, and trappings,
were dug up when the Albert Gate improvements were made.&nbsp; In
Grosvenor Place, and various spots in the Five Fields, similar
remains have also been discovered.</p>
<p>The infamous Lord Howard of Escrick, on <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>whose
perjured evidence Algernon Sidney was beheaded, had a house at
Knightsbridge, and it was the resort of all the desperate and
unprincipled adventurers <a name="citation35"></a><a
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a> who are sure to be
found attached to the ranks even of the noble and high-minded in
such contests as were then going on between Charles II. and the
Whigs.&nbsp; He wrought himself into their consultations, and
pretended entire devotion to their cause; but it was only to ruin
their plans and consign the leaders to the scaffold.</p>
<p>Roger North, in his &ldquo;Examen,&rdquo; states that when the
Rye House Plot became known, the King commanded Howard&rsquo;s
apprehension, and accordingly the Serjeant-at-Arms proceeded to
Knightsbridge, beset his house, and going in to search for him,
&ldquo;though he found the bed warm where he lay,&rdquo; yet
could not find him, till at last they discovered him hidden
behind a chimney, on which &ldquo;he came out in his shirt and
yielded himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saved himself, as is well known,
by despicably witnessing against others: the ballads and satires
of the day contain many allusions to him, and his promised <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>deeds, of
which the following may serve as a specimen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Was it not a damn&rsquo;d thing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That Russell and Hampden,<br />
Should serve all the projects of hot-headed Tory?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But much more untoward<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To appoint my Lord Howard<br />
Of his own purse and credit, to raise men and money,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who at Knightsbridge did hide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those brisk boys unspy&rsquo;d,<br />
That at Shaftsbury&rsquo;s whistle were ready to follow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But when aid he should bring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a true Brentford king,<br />
He was here with a whoop, and there with a hollo.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lord Howard died in 1683, and was succeeded by his son
Charles, at whose death, in 1715, the sullied title became
extinct.</p>
<p>Our hamlet has one more association with Stuart plots; but
this time the Stuarts&rsquo; partisans were the plotters.&nbsp;
In 1694 Sir William Barclay and Sir William Perkins, two staunch
Jacobites, formed a plot for the assassination of William III.;
the plan being to waylay the King on his return to Kensington
from some hunting excursion, and shoot him.&nbsp; The plan
required a number of conspirators to render it successful, and
herein lay the monarch&rsquo;s safety.&nbsp; Captain Porter, one
of the first to join, gave notice to the ministers, and several
engaged in the crime <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>were apprehended.&nbsp; Porter, on
the trial, stated that he had been with two others to survey the
ground, lying at the Swan at Knightsbridge one night, and there
talking over their plans.&nbsp; Finally, it was agreed to commit
the foul deed in a lane near to Turnham Green.&nbsp; Perkins and
others were found guilty on most clear evidence, and suffered
death at Tyburn accordingly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Knightsbridge
Volunteers</span>.&mdash;Notwithstanding the declaration of our
brave tars on the threatened invasion of our shores, by Napoleon
in 1803, that he should not come by <i>water</i>, great
excitement prevailed, and volunteers were enrolled from one end
of the country to the other, and a deadlier contest never cursed
the earth than such would have been, had the Emperor dared to put
his project into execution.&nbsp; Among those earnest men who at
this crisis rendered genuine service to the country by their
energies in this particular, was Major Robert Eyre, an officer
who had seen much and real service in the American War of
Independence, and elsewhere, but who had now settled down at
Knightsbridge, where for years he resided, one of the most
respected of its <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>inhabitants.&nbsp; He offered to raise a corps in the
hamlet, although it had already furnished a number of men to the
regiments of the surrounding locality.&nbsp; His offer was
accepted in the following terms:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">London, August 14th,
1803.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Lord Hobart has
acquainted me, that the King has derived great satisfaction from
the zeal and public spirit which have been manifested by the
offer lately communicated to me by you, which his Majesty has
most graciously been pleased to approve and accept.&nbsp; You
will be pleased to name your officers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">I have the honour to be, Sir,<br />
Your most obedient servant,<br />
<span class="smcap">Scott Titchfield</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>To Major Robert Eyre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The regiment was raised at the Major&rsquo;s expense,
numbering 146 men, and he brought them to a high state of
efficiency.&nbsp; Major Eyre presented them with a pair of
colours, one of which, a blue flag, has on it a painted rebus
device, of a knight in armour riding over a <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>bridge,
emblematical of the name of the hamlet. <a

</a></p>
<p>On the 26th and 28th October, 1803, King George III. in great
state and formality reviewed the volunteers of the metropolis in
Hyde Park.&nbsp; The Knightsbridge regiment appeared on the
latter day, and the vast body acquitted themselves with great
satisfaction to the authorities.&nbsp; In the United Service
Institution Library is preserved a paper confidentially
communicated to the commander of every regiment, describing the
position each corps was to take up in case alarm should <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>occur, and
from it I find that the 1st Battalion of the Queen&rsquo;s Royal
Volunteer Infantry, Col. Hobart, were to patrol along Grosvenor
Place and Pimlico, to the Palace, and along Piccadilly, to
communicate with the 2nd Battalion of the same regiment, and the
St. Margaret&rsquo;s and St. George&rsquo;s Regiments.&nbsp; This
2nd Battalion were to patrol Sloane Street, leaving one company
in Chelsea Waterworks, and to communicate with the Knightsbridge
corps, who were to remain in reserve at the north end of Sloane
Street.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Riots at Knightsbridge</span>.&mdash;In
those good old electioneering times, &ldquo;the days when George
III. was king,&rdquo; our hamlet was many a time the scene of
riot.&nbsp; Such scenes, of course, will not be here detailed;
but two of them were too serious to be passed over entirely,
viz., on March 28th, 1768, and October 4th, 1803.&nbsp; On the
former occasion, Wilkes and Cooke were elected for Middlesex; it
was customary for a London mob to meet the Brentford one in and
about Knightsbridge; and as Wilkes&rsquo; opponent was riding
through with a body of his supporters, one of them hoisted a
flag, on which was inscribed, &ldquo;No Blasphemer,&rdquo; and <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>terrible
violence instantly ensued.&nbsp; At the latter election, Burdett
was the popular candidate, and the excitement, which had been
very great throughout, culminated with the junction of the mobs
at Knightsbridge, causing much confusion and damage.</p>
<p>The last riot in Knightsbridge was on the occasion of the
funeral of Honey and Francis (who were shot in the rioting on the
occasion of the funeral of Caroline of Brunswick) on August 26th,
1821.&nbsp; It occasioned a correspondence between the Sheriff
and the Government; and being fully described therein, I insert
it here.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Mr.
Sheriff Waithman to Earl Bathurst</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I consider it my
duty to apprise his Majesty&rsquo;s Government, through your
Lordship, of a violent outrage on the public peace, committed by
some individuals of the Life Guards, at Knightsbridge, yesterday,
and of an attempt at assassination upon me personally, while in
the execution of my duty as Sheriff of Middlesex, as the head of
the civil power of the county.</p>
<p>Your Lordship thought proper to direct the <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>Lord Mayor on
Saturday to take the necessary measures to preserve the peace of
the city, during the intended funeral of Honey and Francis; and,
although no such caution was addressed to the Sheriff, as
conservator of the public peace of the county, I felt it my duty
to direct the deputy-sheriffs of the city and county to order out
the constables of the divisions nearest to, and through which the
funeral was expected to pass; and also to attend in person, with
proper officers, to prevent or quell any tumult or disorder.</p>
<p>Conceiving that under the existing irritation of the people,
and the circumstances for which they had assembled, some insult
might be offered to the Life Guards in their barracks, I disposed
of the constables chiefly in that vicinity, and actually ranged a
body of them in front of the barracks, with instructions to
apprehend every person who should attempt to commit any outrage
or disorder.</p>
<p>The funeral, in consequence of these precautions, passed the
barracks in an orderly and quiet manner, marked by no other
peculiar circumstance than that of a brick being thrown from the
barracks, which fell near my horse, <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>and wounded, as I am informed, a
young girl.&nbsp; My admonitions, and the presence of the
constables, succeeded, however, in repressing the irritation this
wanton act was calculated to excite.</p>
<p>When the procession had passed, and while the road continued
to be crowded with people, the gates of the barracks were thrown
open, and the avenue filled with soldiers.&nbsp; The people, as
might have been foreseen, gathered round the spot, and expressed
their displeasure.</p>
<p>A tumult seemed inevitable.&nbsp; I requested to speak to the
officer on duty, but without effect; and, at length, by repeated
expostulations with the soldiers, I succeeded in prevailing on
them to retire and close the gates.</p>
<p>Some time after, upon returning to the same spot, I saw a
number of soldiers running from the wicker gate, and pursuing the
people on the causeway.&nbsp; Finding an affray actually
commenced, I sprung my horse upon the causeway, interposed
between the parties, and succeeded in separating them.&nbsp;
While thus engaged, a soldier, with whom I had before been
expostulating, and who was, therefore, acquainted with <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>my official
situation, started forward at a man, and knocked him down.&nbsp;
At the same time, while using my utmost endeavours to prevail on
the soldiers to retire into the barracks, and the people to
desist and keep the peace, the bridle of my horse was violently
seized, on the one side by a young officer in undress, and on the
other by the soldier whose violence I had just noticed, and who,
together, endeavoured to throw my horse over the causeway; and I
only succeeded in extricating myself by striking the soldier with
my stick, and making my horse plunge.&nbsp; Immediately several
of the soldiers rushed at me with their swords drawn, and one
actually loaded his carbine, and directed it towards me, but was,
I am informed, knocked down by one of the constables.&nbsp;
Further mischief was prevented by the interposition of some
military officers of higher authority, and the soldiers at length
retired into their barracks.</p>
<p>My Lord, these circumstances require no comment.&nbsp; At a
critical juncture the soldiers were left to their own exasperated
feeling, and manifested a lawless spirit.&nbsp; The civil power
under my direction was fully adequate for the <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>preservation
of the peace among the people, but not to encounter an armed
soldiery.&nbsp; I had no communication from his Majesty&rsquo;s
Government, nor could I obtain an interview with any of the
officers of the regiment. . . .&nbsp; I feel assured that had I
not interposed with the civil power and even risked my own life,
a frightful slaughter must have ensued.&nbsp; Of subordination to
civil authority the soldiers appeared to be wholly unconscious,
and that authority, in my person, was repeatedly insulted, and
grossly outraged.</p>
<p>It would, my Lord, be as needless as presumptuous in me to
attempt to instruct your Lordship and his Majesty&rsquo;s
Government in the nature of the constitutional authority under
which I attended yesterday, or the right I possessed in my
official character to have claimed the aid and assistance of
these very military to suppress tumult, who have, upon this
occasion, in open defiance of the civil authority, been the
promoters of it; nor need I add one word in aggravation of the
enormity of the offences committed: the offenders can some of
them be identified, and I trust your Lordship will cause
immediate and effectual means to be adopted <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>to bring them
to justice, as a salutary example to others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> parish church of St. Margaret,
Westminster, is the mother church of this locality.&nbsp;
Although the Decree of 1222, before referred to, limited the
western boundary of that parish to the Tyburn stream, it declared
that beyond that stream lay the town of Knightsbridge, which
belonged to it.&nbsp; In what parish the manor of Eia was
situated is not stated, but it is most likely that the higher
portion of it was a forest, and the lower, it is certain, was
partly a marsh, and consequently altogether unnoticed by the
assessors; for the growth of parishes was very gradual, and their
proper boundaries for ages undefined.&nbsp; <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>St.
Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields is mentioned as early as 1225, but
did not become a regular parish till after 1337, and not
independent of St. Margaret&rsquo;s till 1535.&nbsp; In St.
Martin&rsquo;s the whole of the manor of Eia was then included;
it consequently reached as far as the Westbourne, and included a
part of Knightsbridge; this arrangement continued till the parish
of St. George, Hanover Square, in 1724, was formed out of St.
Martin&rsquo;s, and then this distant part was included, absurdly
enough, within the new parish.</p>
<p>On the west of the rivulet, which here divides St.
George&rsquo;s parish from St. Margaret&rsquo;s and Chelsea, the
hamlet stands partly in those and partly in Kensington
parish.&nbsp; St. Margaret&rsquo;s stretches from William Street,
behind Lowndes Terrace, across the top of Sloane Street, behind
Brompton Road, continuing the line behind Arthur Street to the
bottom of Ennismore Mews, where, abutting on the north wall of
Brompton Churchyard, it strikes off in a north-west direction and
crosses the Kensington Road just below Hyde Park Terrace, whence
it runs along the road into the town, and, including a few houses
on <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>the
north side of High Street, it enters the Royal Gardens, including
a considerable portion thereof, and the whole of the palace,
within its boundary; it joins Paddington at a point on the
Uxbridge Road, and thence returns through the Serpentine to
Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>The parish officers of St. Margaret alone beat the bounds now,
and they appear always to have been strict in this duty, which,
from some entries in their books, one would consider to have been
a little festive occasionally:&mdash;</p>

<p>Chelsea parish includes Lowndes Square and the adjoining
streets, while Kensington includes Queen&rsquo;s Buildings, and a
few houses in Sloane Street.&nbsp; Thus is Knightsbridge absurdly
divided, when for generations there has existed within it a place
of worship which could have been easily rendered the focus of a
new and independent parish, had its patrons been so minded.&nbsp;
The opportunity was lost when St. George&rsquo;s was formed, and
Trinity Chapel, from having been, as it were, the nursing-mother
around which the village gathered, was permitted to dwindle,
without a thought for it, into comparative insignificance.&nbsp;
This ancient religious edifice I will now give an account of.</p>
<h3>TRINITY CHAPEL</h3>
<p>Was anciently attached to a Lazar-house or Hospital, with the
history of which it is most <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>intimately connected.&nbsp; When or
by whom founded is not known&mdash;at least, if such is recorded,
it is not mentioned by any writer on ecclesiastical affairs; but
as it appears always to have been attached to the Abbey of
Westminster, we may conclude its foundation was connected with
that establishment.</p>
<p>The earliest mention I have met with of the Lazar-house is in
a grant of James I., preserved in the British Museum, <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1605, <span

<p>But, although this is the earliest document concerning the
Lazar-house I have seen, there exist earlier, to which the public
have not access.&nbsp; Lysons says there is, among the records of
the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, a statement of its condition
in 1595, drawn up by John Glassington, Governor of the House, by
profession a surgeon, and whose family rented the hospital,
&amp;c., from the Church of Westminster (at the rent of 4s. per
annum) for many years.&nbsp; In this document he states that
there were no lands belonging to this hospital, nor a groat of
endowment; that there had been a certain piece, which was then
enclosed within Hyde Park, to the great detriment of the
charity.&nbsp; He also states that when he became governor, the
building was ready to fall; that he had expended above &pound;100
on it; that there were commonly thirty-six or thirty-seven <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>persons in
the house, who were supported by voluntary contributions; that
the charge of the previous year, in provisions only, and
exclusive of candles, linen, woollen, salves, medicines, burials,
&amp;c., had been &pound;161 19s. 4d.&nbsp; He adds a list of
fifty-five persons whom he had cured, some of whom had been
dismissed as incurable from other hospitals.&nbsp; An account of
the regulations of the house is subjoined by him, by which it
appears that the patients attended prayers every morning and
evening, and that on Sundays there was morning and evening
service for the neighbours; that those who were able were obliged
to work; that they dined every day on &ldquo;warm meat and
porrege,&rdquo; and that every man had his own &ldquo;dish,
platter, and tankard, to kepe the broken from the whole.&rdquo;
<a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<p>In the parish accounts of St. Margaret&rsquo;s are several
entries relating to this hospital:</p>

<p>There are no books or accounts of the Lazar-house existing at
the Chapel now, neither have I been able to ascertain whether
they exist elsewhere, or even at all.&nbsp; But in one of the
register books still preserved is a list of persons discharged
from it; the date of the year is not given, but I have reason to
think it about 1676.&nbsp; There are twenty-seven entries, of
which the following may serve as samples:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>March 5&mdash;Priscilla Knight to London,
criple.</p>
<p>,, 6&mdash;Mary ffranklin to Berkshire.</p>
<p>,, 9&mdash;John Wordner, his wife, to children, to Bristow,
criple.</p>
<p>,, 10&mdash;Nicholas fflood, his wife, 4 children, to Wales,
criple.</p>
<p>,, 18&mdash;Robert Dicerson, his wife, 2 children, to
Gloster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These unfortunate creatures most probably begged their way up
from the country, and, while inmates here, owed their subsistence
to charitable contributions, and, when cured, had to beg their
way home again.&nbsp; There was also <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>the following entry in another book,
date about 1695:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thomas Pirkin, a soldier under Captain John
Callipfield, in Brigadier Solwin&rsquo;s regiment, died in
Hospital in August last past.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like its origin, its end is obscure: I cannot trace when, or
from what causes, its useful and Christian career was
terminated.&nbsp; It was certainly existing when Newcourt was
collecting materials for his &ldquo;Repertorium,&rdquo; published
in 1720, and that is the last allusion to it I can find.</p>
<p>It has always been traditionally related in Knightsbridge,
that during the fatal year of the plague, 1666, the institution
was for a while given up to those who had been attacked by that
scourge; and it is also said that the enclosed plot on the Green
was the spot where its victims, here and elsewhere in the
locality, were buried.</p>
<p>In Butler&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hudibras&rdquo; (III. c. ii. v.
1110), among other charges Cooper urges against the Presbyterians
is, that they</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fill&rsquo;d Bedlam with predestination,<br
/>
And Knightsbridge with illumination.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the last editor of Gray&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hudibras&rdquo; <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>supposes that
by the Presbyterian Illuminati here, Butler alluded to the
unfortunate inmates of this Lazar-house! <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a></p>
<p>There were three other similar establishments in the suburbs
of London&mdash;namely, at Southwark, Kingsland, and
Mile-end.&nbsp; Great care was taken that those afflicted with
leprosy, or other such disorder, should be immediately conveyed
to one of these places.&nbsp; The law was strictly carried out,
and where resistance was made, the sufferers were tied to horses,
and dragged thither. <a name="citation58b"></a><a
href="#footnote58b" class="citation">[58b]</a></p>
<p>That the chapel attached to this hospital was of ancient
foundation, we may justly infer from its being described as
&ldquo;very old and ruinous, and ready to fall,&rdquo; as far
back as 1629.&nbsp; In that year, for that cause, the inhabitants
petitioned Laud, who then filled the see of London, for leave to
rebuild it at their own cost, it being the place to which they
usually resorted &ldquo;to perform their religious duties and
devotions.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bishop, by his licence, dated <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>July 7th,
1629, gave them permission so to do (the consent of the vicar and
churchwardens of St. Martin&rsquo;s being first obtained),
&ldquo;therein to frequent Divine Service and sermons, which
Divine offices were to be performed by a sufficient minister,
lawfully licensed from time to time,&rdquo; by the Bishops of
London, or their Chancellors for the time being; &ldquo;provided
that the said inhabitants, or their families, did once every
quarter of a year repair to their respective parish churches to
perform their devotions, and every Easter receive the Holy
Communion there, and pay all rights, duties, and profits to their
respective ministers to which they did belong,&rdquo; and this
licence was to continue in force during the pleasure of the
Bishops of London.</p>
<p>The Chapel was accordingly rebuilt, and &ldquo;consecrated to
the use of the poor of the Hospital,&rdquo; who &ldquo;having no
maintenance but what they received of alms,&rdquo; and not being
&ldquo;able to maintain a curate, repair the Chapel, or relieve
themselves,&rdquo; it was, on October 3rd, 1634, according to an
arrangement made by the Master of the Hospital, the curate, and
some of the principal inhabitants of Knightsbridge, <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>ordered by
Dr. Duck, then Chancellor of London, that they, or the major part
of them, should let certain pews and seats in such manner as
should best effect these objects; that they should keep a
register of their accounts, which were to be adjusted every six
months, reserving to the incumbents of St. Margaret&rsquo;s and
St. Martin&rsquo;s their respective rights and emoluments.&nbsp;
Dr. Duck presented one piece of the plate used in the celebration
of the Communion.</p>
<p>In 1650 the Parliamentary Commissioners appointed to inquire
into the state of ecclesiastical benefices, reported that
Knightsbridge Chapel, in the parish of St. Martin-in-the-Fields,
belonged to a Lazar-house there; that twenty years before the
date of inquiry it was re-edified and enlarged by public
contributions; and that Henry Walker, the minister, placed there
on probation by order of Parliament, received &pound;10 per annum
from the inhabitants.&nbsp; The Commissioners afterwards allowed
him &pound;40 per annum. <a name="citation60"></a><a
href="#footnote60" class="citation">[60]</a></p>
<p>Among the records of the Dean and Chapter <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>is a petition
from John Glassington, surgeon, dated 1654, praying to be
admitted Governor of the Hospital, which his ancestors had always
rented of the church at Westminster; which petition is
accompanied by a certificate of Sir John Thorowgood, one of the
Commissioners for Middlesex, and an active public officer in this
locality at the time of the Commonwealth; but I infer the
application was unsuccessful for a time, for in the next year
Henry Walker was presented to the curacy by Cornelius Holland and
George Reeve, <i>joint-governors</i> of the Chapel.&nbsp; John
Glassington was, however, Governor in 1659.</p>
<p>In 1699, Nicholas Birkhead, who was then lessee of the Chapel,
rebuilt it, and the present building is mainly his work.&nbsp; In
1789, it was enlarged by its front being brought in a line with
the adjoining houses, a grass-plot eight feet deep having
previously occupied this space.&nbsp; The present front,
galleries, &amp;c., were then erected.&nbsp; At the end of the
last century Dixon Gamble, Esq., became lessee, but now it is
held direct from the Dean and Chapter of Westminster, who
nominate the incumbent.&nbsp; There is an endowment of &pound;30
per annum payable by <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>them, but the income is derived
chiefly from the pew rents.</p>
<p>The Chapel is as plain an edifice as possibly can be; there is
no ornament of any kind about it.&nbsp; It is built of brick, and
is 53 feet long, by 30 feet broad.&nbsp; The gallery is round
three sides of the building; the organ, built by Hancock, 1770,
being on the south side.&nbsp; The communion-table is at the
<i>north</i> end.&nbsp; The front terminates in a pediment, over
which is a small cupola containing one bell, thus
inscribed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Mrs. Mary Birkhed gaue me</span>, 1733.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the brickwork are let in three stone slabs, the centre of
which is inscribed &ldquo;Knightsbridge Chapel, 1789;&rdquo; that
on the right is inscribed, &ldquo;Rebuilte by Nicho Birkhead,
Gouldsmith of London, Anno Dom. 1699;&rdquo; the left or western
one has the following emphatic dedication cut in it, <a

succeeded by the Rev. Hibbert Binney, D.C.L., the late minister,
who, since June, 1838 (when he was appointed rector of Newbury),
left the chapel to the ministry of the Rev. John Wilson, now
D.D., and the present incumbent.&nbsp; Dr. Binney died June 6th,
1857.&nbsp; Among assistant ministers here have been the Rev.
Alexander Cleeve, author of several devotional works, who died
September 23rd, 1805; the Rev. H. J. Symons, LL.D., who read the
burial service over Sir John Moore at Corunna.&nbsp; He gained
the notice of the Duke of York in this pulpit, and quitted it for
the Peninsula with a regiment, to which he was chaplain.</p>
<p>Baptisms and marriages were formerly solemnised here, and
twenty register-books, some very small, and others quarto and
folio size, are still preserved.&nbsp; Many of them, however, are
but duplicates of the others, and three are memorandum-books of
the clerks, with registrations, expenses, notices, and other
entries therein.&nbsp; The <i>regular register of baptisms</i>
has been missing a very long while, but duplicates of several
years have been preserved; with the exception of a few leaves,
all the books <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>of expenses are lost also. <a name="citation67"></a><a
href="#footnote67" class="citation">[67]</a>&nbsp; I have stated
before that the books of the Lazar-house are also missing, and so
is the burial book, if such ever existed.&nbsp; I shall be glad
to quit this statement, so disgraceful to some of the former
officials of the Chapel, and give a few extracts from those still
fortunately preserved.</p>
<p>Previous to the passing of Lord Hardwick&rsquo;s celebrated
Marriage Act, in 1753, it was not necessary to the validity of a
marriage that such should be performed in a church, or solemnised
by any religious ceremony.&nbsp; And although the law of the
Church visited with censure those who neglected its canon in this
respect, yet the Common Law recognised other and more private
modes.&nbsp; Consequently around and in London, at almost all the
chapels, marriages were performed, and at some in a very
discreditable manner.&nbsp; Lord Hardwick&rsquo;s bill made it
necessary to the validity of a marriage that it should be
solemnised in a parish church or <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>public chapel where banns had been
regularly published.&nbsp; The result was, that as at these
chapels banns were not published, marriages therein solemnised
were no longer legal; and among others obliged to succumb to this
law, Knightsbridge Chapel was one.</p>
<p>It would almost appear that our Chapel had some reputation for
its irregularities in this solemnity, if we are to trust some of
the pointed allusions in the literature of a bygone
currency.&nbsp; Shadwell, in his play of &ldquo;The Sullen
Lovers,&rdquo; published in 1668, makes Lovell say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s rally no longer: there is a
person at Knightsbridge, that yokes all stray people together;
we&rsquo;ll to him, he&rsquo;ll despatch us presently, and send
us away as lovingly as any two fools that ever yet were condemned
to marriage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in the <i>Guardian</i> (No. 14, March 27, 1713), a
run-away marriage is spoken of as being celebrated &ldquo;last
night at Knightsbridge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Although such references
seem to illustrate what could be only known as a fact, I yet
think they were but a jocular remark as regards Knightsbridge,
and not indications of a reality.&nbsp; It is scarcely possible
to think such would have been allowed in a place of worship, so
much under the control of the Dean and <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Chapter as this was; and many
memoranda in the books vindicate its ministers from the charge of
winking at wrong, as these allusions insinuate.&nbsp; Of these
curious entries I give the following as specimens:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Mem</span>.&mdash;Thomas Palmer and Ann Clarke: if
they come to be maryed, stop them, and send for Mr. Clarke, next
doore to the Mitre Tavern in Duppin&rsquo;s Ally, King Street,
Westminster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Squire, silver-smith, living in Long Acre, who
stood father to Elizabeth Goldingham, who was married to Edward
Keyn ye 20th of ffebruary, 1690/1, does give this account of the
said Elizabeth Goldingham, that she has lodged at his house for 2
years, that she is no heyress, but ffollows the trade of a
manta-maker for her living, and further he adds that she has
neither ffather or mother liveing, nor no relation who does any
way look affter her, but that she is really at her own
disposal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But although such entries show the rule, I must admit that at
a certain period before the time to which the foregoing entries
refer, are others which appear suspicious; and if any <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>irregularities occurred I should place them between the
two extreme dates, shown in the following extracts:&mdash;</p>
<p>1678, April 28.&nbsp; Jacob Stent and Mary Crouch, secrecy for
life.</p>
<p>1678, April 28.&nbsp; James Gibson and Anne Tarrant,
secrecy.</p>
<p>1678/9, April 28.&nbsp; William Taylor and Elizabeth Steward,
great secrecy.</p>
<p>1680, April 25.&nbsp; Edward Charlton and Alice Robinson,
secret for 14 years.</p>
<p>1682, May 7.&nbsp; Andrew Barry and Mary Elton, secrecy.</p>
<p>With these curious notices of old systems, habits, and ideas,
I proceed to give some extracts from the registers, selecting
those referring to eminent persons, and which contain allusions
of interest and peculiarity.&nbsp; The earliest entry of baptisms
is the following.</p>
<p>1663, Aug. 28.&nbsp; Will, ye sone of will birke of this
hamlett, by Mr. Herring.</p>
<p>1667, Jan. 23.&nbsp; Sofiah London, the daughter of Richard
London and Mary his wife.</p>
<p>A family named London lived in this locality many years, and
there are several entries of the name.&nbsp; Probably the
celebrated gardener so <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>named, who will be afterwards
noticed, belonged to it.</p>
<p>1668.&nbsp; Nathaniel, son of William Ipsley, baptised,
September 8th.</p>
<p>Most probably this name should be Hipsley.&nbsp; Persons of
this name were clerks here many years.</p>
<p>1670, Nov. 3.&nbsp; James, son of James and Mary Rouse.</p>
<p>1675, Feb. 19.&nbsp; Dorothy, daughter of James Took, Esq.,
and Magdalen his wife.&nbsp; Westminster parish.</p>
<p>1675, April 11.&nbsp; William Lord, son of Robert and Anne
Thurlow.</p>
<p>A family of this name lived in the St. Margaret&rsquo;s part
of the hamlet in the 17th century.</p>
<p>1675, Nov. 5.&nbsp; Joan, daughter of Robert and Hester
Gunter, baptised.</p>
<p>Persons of this name may be traced from this period to the
present time in our locality.&nbsp; It is the earliest entry of
the name I have found.</p>
<p>1676, Jan. 8.&nbsp; Margerite, the daughter of Elizabeth
Bedford by Mr. Philip Thomas.</p>
<p>1677, June 17.&nbsp; Tristram, the son of Tristram and Anne
Huddlestone.</p>
<p>1677, July 20.&nbsp; George, son of Berkley Trye, <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Esq., by Mary
his wife, baptised by Jo. Andrews, entered at St.
Martin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The Tryes are a very ancient Gloucestershire family.</p>
<p>1678, Jan. 3.&nbsp; Robert, son of Robert and Hester
Gunter.</p>
<p>1681, April 11.&nbsp; Anne, the daughter of George Sams by
Martha Wheatley, his servant, as &rsquo;tis told me.</p>
<p>1682, May 27.&nbsp; Thomas Dennis, 30 years of age, was
baptised.</p>
<p>1683, March 4.&nbsp; Jane Rutter was baptised.&nbsp; A black
woman.</p>
<p>1689, June 27.&nbsp; ffrances Wharton, the daughter of Jane
Wharton, a child of base (birth).</p>
<p>1691, Dec. 21.&nbsp; Hannah Hipsley, daughter of Thomas and
Mary Hipsley, by Mr. Watts.&nbsp; Born Dec. 6th.</p>
<p>1692, Feb. 14.&nbsp; Margaret Tarbet, the daughter of Margaret
Perryvil; being a woman-child that fell in travail in ye
street.</p>
<p>1702.&nbsp; Mary, daughter of Thomas Werd by Mary his wife,
was baptised the 3rd of May by Mr. Killberk.</p>
<p>This is the last baptism recorded, and only <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>one is
entered between October 16th, 1694, and this date: the others are
missing; and though I know baptisms were occasionally solemnised
here even to the end of the last century, no later record has
been preserved.</p>
<h3>MARRIAGES.</h3>
<p>There are no registers of marriages here now, anterior to
April 1st, 1658, but in the Bishop&rsquo;s register are some
earlier ones, the first of which is the following:&mdash;</p>
<p>16th April, 1632.&nbsp; Thomas Herbert, of Hammond Head, com.
York, Esq., bachelor, 24; and Lucy Alexander, spinster, 20,
daughter of Sir William Alexander.</p>
<p>The earliest in the Chapel register book is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1658, April 1.&nbsp; William Eaton and Jane Hurley were

<p>1661, ffeb. 10.&nbsp; Richard Steele and Eliza Cotterill per
me Ant. Dode.</p>
<p>1666, July 17.&nbsp; William Adkins and Katherine Edwards at
ye Bowling Green.</p>
<p>The Bowling Green was perhaps at the Spring Garden, afterwards
to be noticed.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>1666,
Oct. 14.&nbsp; Thomas Clark and Elizabeth Milton.</p>
<p>1667, April 16.&nbsp; Philip Wharton and Hester Bewley.</p>

Russell by Mr. James Symonds.</p>
<p>1678, July 23.&nbsp; Sir James Hayes and Grace Clavering.</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>1678,
August 3.&nbsp; Sir John Lenthall and ye Lady Catherine Lant,
secrecy, by Mr. Joseph Stretch, minister.</p>
<p>Sir John Lenthall, only son of the Speaker, was Governor of
Windsor, under Cromwell, and knighted by him in 1657.&nbsp; On
May 21, 1660, he moved in the House of Commons that all who had
borne arms against the king should be exempted from pardon; and
for such was called to the bar, reprimanded, and degraded his
knighthood.&nbsp; He afterwards lost his seat upon petition
against his return.&nbsp; He died in 1681.</p>
<p>1678, August 15.&nbsp; Robert Grime and Barbara January, the
king&rsquo;s taylor, nexte doore to 3 tuns taverne lane.</p>
<p>1679, April 10.&nbsp; Thomas Lant, esq., and Mrs. Jane
Bromfield.</p>
<p>1681, Feb. 20.&nbsp; John Stibbs and Sarah Cromwell.</p>
<p>For the last 250 years a family named Cromwell&mdash;and
which, in the last century, branched out considerably&mdash;has
been resident in this part of Middlesex.&nbsp; Cromwell, the
minister of Henry VIII., was born at Putney, not far out of the
county; and Sir Richard Cromwell <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>(grandfather to Oliver the
Protector), signed himself in letters to the &ldquo;Mauler of
Monasteries&rdquo; <i>his most bounden nephew</i>.&nbsp; In 1691
a Robert Cromwell lived at Kensal Green, and is probably the
person of the same name who sat on the jury at the trial of
Daniel Axtell.&nbsp; For many years a brewery at Hammersmith has
been conducted by persons of this name, not improbably
descendants from the Putney blacksmith.</p>
<p>1682, January 31st.&nbsp; John Cull, curate of Knightsbridge,
and Martha Turner, by Mr. Yearwood.</p>
<p>Mr. Cull was minister here twelve years.&nbsp; He died in
1683, and was buried at Kensington on the 21st September.</p>
<p>1682, Dec. 24.&nbsp; Sir John Hatton and Mary Hinton.</p>
<p>1683, July 3rd.&nbsp; Heale Hooke, Baronet, and Hester
Underhill by Seyward of Kensington.</p>
<p>Sir Hele Hooke, for many years a resident in Kensington
Square, died there in July, 1712, by which the title became
extinct.&nbsp; Mr. Seward was curate there.&nbsp; (See
Faulkner&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Kensington.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>1685, Sept. 12.&nbsp; David Gunter and Eliz. West.</p>
<p><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>1686,
Sept. 4.&nbsp; Sir Francis de Geilhausen and Flora Bishop for
Feb. 6, 1685.</p>
<p>1687, Feb. 1.&nbsp; Sir Samuel Morland, Knight, and Mrs. Mary
Aylif, secrecy.</p>
<p>This entry records the unfortunate marriage of the celebrated
inventor, described by himself in such terms of misery, to the
diarist Pepys.&nbsp; In all the biographies of Morland I have
referred to, and even in Burke, his wife&rsquo;s name is not
given, and therefore I presume it has hitherto been
unknown.&nbsp; The wedding was, as the register tells, private;
and eighteen days after it took place, he wrote to Pepys, that,
&ldquo;being in very great perplexities, and almost distracted
for want of moneys,&rdquo; a person whom he had befriended in
time of need proposed to recommend him an heiress, &ldquo;who had
500<i>l.</i> per ann. in land, and 4,000<i>l.</i> in ready
money,&rdquo; and property of other kinds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Believing
it,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;utterly impossible,&rdquo; that one
whom he had assisted, &ldquo;should ever be guilty of so black a
deed&rdquo; as to betray him in his distress, &ldquo;I was, about
a fortnight since, led as a fool to the stocks, and married a
coachman&rsquo;s daughter, not worth a shilling,&rdquo; and whose
moral character <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>proved to be none of the purest.&nbsp; He, procuring
evidence (shortly after) of adultery, took the case into the
Ecclesiastical Court, which granted a divorce on that ground on
May 17. <a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a>&nbsp; It was the <i>fourth</i> time Sir
Samuel tied the matrimonial knot, and the <i>last</i>.</p>
<p>1687, May 3.&nbsp; Sir William Moet, and Antonetta
Willobe.</p>
<p>1687, Sept. 1.&nbsp; John Atley and Mary Crumwell.</p>
<p>1689, Jan. 7.&nbsp; Richard Bailey and Eliz. Shakespeare.</p>
<p>1690, July 20.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Fautherly and Mrs. Frances
Brown.</p>
<p>1690, July 31.&nbsp; John Lenthall and Eliz. Wildman.</p>

Westminster.</p>
<p>1697, Jan. 30.&nbsp; Jasper Arnold, Gent., of St. James,
Westminster, and Antonett Culmer of Kensington, spinster.</p>
<p>The Arnolds were a numerous and opulent family long resident
in Westminster.&nbsp; Families of the same name, and probably
connected, also resided in Knightsbridge and Kensington for above
a century.&nbsp; One of the Westminster Arnolds was a brewer, and
a juryman on the trial of the Seven Bishops.&nbsp; (See
&ldquo;Macaulay&rsquo;s History.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>1698, August 21.&nbsp; George Cumming, Taylor, at ye
Woolstaple, near great Tom, St. Margaret&rsquo;s, Westminster,
and Mary Watson of the same place.</p>
<p>1698, Dec. 18.&nbsp; William ffinton, Life Guardsman in

<p>1699, May 23.&nbsp; Thomas Fenwick of St. Margaret&rsquo;s,
Westminster, serv<sup>t</sup> to Storey at ye Park Gate, and Mary
Gregory of ye same.</p>
<p>This notice is curious: Story&rsquo;s Gate, named from the
person here noticed, is the entrance into St. James&rsquo;s Park
from Bridge Street.&nbsp; Story was keeper of the Aviary to
Charles II., hence Birdcage Walk.</p>
<p>1699, August 18.&nbsp; Cornelius Vander Velde, Limner, of St.
Giles&rsquo;, living in Dyot street, over agt ye Sparrow&rsquo;s
Nest, and Bernada Vander Hagen, of ye same.</p>
<p>Cornelius Vander Velde was brother to William Vander Velde the
elder, the great painter of sea pieces.&nbsp; He was himself a
painter of nautical subjects, and in the employ of Charles
II.&nbsp; This is an addition to Walpole&rsquo;s notices.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>1699,

entertaining the new king at Guildhall, was made a baronet.&nbsp;
His wife was widow of a London merchant.</p>
<p>1705, Jan. 8.&nbsp; Charles Danvers and Margaret Evans.</p>
<p>Danvers has been a name in Chelsea these 250 years past, and
is still to be found there.&nbsp; Sir John Danvers, of Chelsea,
was one who signed the death-warrant of Charles I.</p>
<p>1705, May 23.&nbsp; Henry Graham, Esq., and Mary, Countess of
Darentwater.</p>
<p>This lady was the youngest natural daughter of Charles II., by
Mrs. Davis the actress, and known before marriage as Lady Mary
Tudor.&nbsp; On August 18, 1687, being then only in her
fourteenth year, she was married to Edward Radcliffe, afterwards
second earl of Derwentwater, by whom she became mother of that
ill-fated earl executed on Tower Hill for his share in the
Rebellion of 1715; of Charles Radcliffe, who also perished on the
scaffold thirty years after, and of two other children.&nbsp; Her
husband, from whom she separated in 1700, died April 29, <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>1705; and
within a month, as this record shows, she married Henry Graham of
Levens, Esq., who died the following year.&nbsp; She married
thirdly James Rooke, whom she likewise survived.&nbsp; She died
at Paris, November 5, 1726, in her fifty-fourth year.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Robinson, grandson of Sir Thomas Robinson, killed

<p>Regarding burials, the only entry in the books recording such

Smith of Bromtone deced the 5th day of March, and was bereed the
6th day of ye same month 1667.&rdquo;&nbsp; If persons were
interred here in any number, the interments ceased most probably
before 1683, when Mr. Cull was buried at Kensington.&nbsp; No
register of such is to be found now, although the tradition was
very strong that the enclosure on the Green was consecrated for
the resting place of the dead.</p>
<p>Before concluding this account of the Chapel I must notice the
Birkhead family, with whom it was so many years connected.&nbsp;
They appear to have held considerable property in the hamlet, but
I have not been able to trace their history, other than what the
following extracts from the registers inform us:&mdash;</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>1672

<p>Here my account of this ancient foundation, which has
afforded, bodily and spiritually, aid to thousands, before the
more splendid structures which now eclipse it were erected, must
close.&nbsp; I own I feel a deep interest in the old place, shorn
as it is of its usefulness in great measure; and it is with
regret I am compelled to bear witness against those superiors of
the venerable Abbey, to which it was attached, for permitting its
decay to go on, without one single attempt to renovate it with
fresh life and vigour.&nbsp; I cannot find that they have for the
<a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>last 150
years aided it, or held out the parental hand in any way.&nbsp;
They have appointed its ministers, have allowed them a miserable
endowment, and this is the sum of their support.&nbsp; With the
rentals they have drawn from Knightsbridge for so lengthened a
period, Church and Hospital ought now to stand, both flourishing
in useful prosperity, monuments alike to the piety of our
ancestors, and to the conservative care of their descendants, who
had striven to emulate their goodness by the extension of the
blessings their bounty bestowed.&nbsp; Is it so, that in this
district nothing can be done in the nineteenth to remedy the
faults of the eighteenth century?</p>
<p>In connection with Trinity Chapel was a school, founded in
1783, chiefly by the exertions of John Read, who will be
hereafter further noticed.&nbsp; The education afforded was
substantially good, better than most schools of the same kind
generally afforded, and was entirely free.&nbsp; Its support was
derived from the contributions of the public, and collections at
the Chapel.&nbsp; For many years the number was limited to 34
boys and 18 girls, but in 1832 it was increased to 45 boys and 25
girls, beyond which number the income of the Committee <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>would not
allow them to extend.&nbsp; To Mr. Kember, its Treasurer, for
many years the institution mainly owed its existence; but at
length, in 1844, the subscribers at a general meeting transferred
the institution, and attached it to the new church of St.
Paul.</p>
<p>Before this school was founded it would seem one of a similar
kind had previously existed, for Northvouck mentions one here,
but with 6 boys and 6 girls only.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Paul&rsquo;s Church</span>.&mdash;In
this section the two churches to which the Hamlet of
Knightsbridge mainly pertains will be described.&nbsp; St.
Paul&rsquo;s claims priority.</p>
<p>The first stone of St. Paul&rsquo;s was laid November 6th,
1840, in presence of nearly 500 persons, by George Drummond,
Esq., of Wilton Crescent.&nbsp; The want of Church accommodation
had been greatly felt, and in this year measures were taken to
realise that want.&nbsp; Public subscriptions were commenced, and
a large sum subscribed; <a name="citation92"></a><a
href="#footnote92" class="citation">[92]</a> but after the work
had for some <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>time been progressed with, it was stopped from lack of
resources; this difficulty was, however, surmounted, and on June
30th, 1843, the edifice was consecrated by Dr. Blomfield, Bishop
of London, who preached on the occasion from the 4th chapter of
St. John&rsquo;s Gospel, verse 14.</p>
<p>The site on which it stands was formerly an exercising ground
belonging to the foot-barrack, and was given by the Marquis of
Westminster (who likewise contributed &pound;500 towards the
organ), the lease being purchased of the late Mr. Phillips.</p>
<p>The Church is one of the most handsome of modern architecture
in London, and a great credit to its designer Mr. T. Cundy.&nbsp;
Its style is that known as Early Perpendicular; it is 106 feet in
length, by 59 feet 6 inches in breadth; the height is nearly 50
feet.&nbsp; It consists of a nave and two aisles, with a chancel
at the east end on an ascent of four steps; around the Church,
along three of its sides, <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>galleries are placed; in the west
gallery is the organ, and on this side are also galleries above
for the school children.&nbsp; At the west end is a lofty and
very handsome tower, having an arch open on three sides at its
base to form the porch, above which it is carried to the height
of 121 feet, in two storeys, each containing a large and
beautiful window, sides and front.&nbsp; It terminates with an
embattled parapet of open-work, and eight crocketted pinnacles,
four of which rise from the angles.&nbsp; The tower contains a
clock by Dent, and three bells by Meares; the tenor weighs 22
cwt. 11 lbs., second 8 cwt, the small one 6 cwt. 4 lbs.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>The
chancel forms a very handsome termination to the interior; the
reading-desk and pulpit respectively occupy places at the north
and south corners of its entrance, while in advance, occupying a
central position, is the lectern, presented by the Rev. W.
Bennett.&nbsp; In the south side of the chancel are three
<i>sedill&aelig;</i>; over the Communion table are three
compartments of stonework, on which are inscribed the
Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and the Creed; above
the stonework it terminates in a <i>rere-dos</i>, over which is
the great window of stained glass by Wailes, pourtraying the
Prophets and the Twelve Apostles.&nbsp; This window and
ornamental stonework cost about &pound;1,000.</p>
<p>The font is of Caen stone, of beautiful design, and five feet
eight inches in height; it is of octagonal form, the panels being
divided by buttresses, the projecting portion of each resting on
an angel, each angel either clasping its hands, or holding a
shield or book bearing some symbol corresponding with the subject
of the panel immediately preceding.&nbsp; Under each panel is a
boss, representing some plant answering to the subject on the
panel.&nbsp; The shaft, supporting the whole, is placed on two
steps; it consists <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>of eight mullioned arches, and as many buttresses
decorated.&nbsp; It is the work of Mr. Charles Physick, of Gower
Street, and was presented by the Rev. D. A. Beaufort, Mr.
Bennett&rsquo;s successor at Portman Chapel.&nbsp; Its cost was
&pound;100.</p>
<p>The organ is a very powerful one; its case was designed by Mr.
Cundy, and harmonises with the general character of the
Church.&nbsp; It covers 14 feet square, and is 30 feet high.</p>
<p>The roof is open, and is said to be the largest unsupported by
pillars of any ecclesiastical edifice in the metropolis.&nbsp; It
is of timber, and the tie beams are filled with tracery.</p>
<p>Of the eight handsome windows of each side of the church, two
in the north and six in the south are filled with stained glass,
all by Wailes, of Newcastle, representing the most remarkable
scenes and actions of St. Paul, and of those Apostles whose names
are to be read on each window.&nbsp; Four of these windows were
erected to the memory of various members of his family by J. T.
Horne, Esq.; one to John Backhouse, Esq., of the Foreign Office,
born October 14th, 1784, died November 13th, 1845; one to the
late Viscount Newry, to the Misses <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Alice and Caroline Colvile, and one
to Miss Caroline Carr.&nbsp; There is one also to Patrick Fraser
Tytler, born August 30th, 1791, died December 24th, 1849: he was
author of &ldquo;A History of Scotland,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lives of
Sir Walter Raleigh,&rdquo; &ldquo;Henry VIII.,&rdquo; and other
works that have assumed a standard position in our
literature.</p>
<p>The church will hold nearly 1,600 persons; 600 of the sittings
are free.</p>
<p>The Rev. W. J. E. Bennett was nominated to the incumbency by
the Bishop of London; but certain differences having arisen
between him and the Bishop, he resigned in March, 1850, when the
Hon. and Rev. Robert Liddell was appointed in his stead.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the Churchwardens:&mdash;September
30, 1845, Hon. Eliot Yorke, M.P.; Charles Briscoe.&nbsp; (These
gentlemen were re-elected also for the three following
years.)&nbsp; 1849, April 10, Sir John E. Harington, Bart.;
Charles Briscoe.&nbsp; 1850, Sir J. E. Harington; Charles
Briscoe.&nbsp; 1851, April 21, T. H. Sotheron, Esq., M.P.; J. H.
Tuck.&nbsp; 1852, April 13, Viscount Castlereagh; J. H.
Tuck.&nbsp; 1853, March 29, T. H. Horne, Esq.; Charles <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>Westerton.&nbsp; 1854, April 18.&nbsp; This was a
contested election: opposition having been made by Mr. Westerton
to the mode of conducting Divine Service, and other matters
connected with the Church, he was opposed by Thos. Davidson,
Esq.; but after a poll, the numbers were declared to be&mdash;for
Mr. Westerton, 203; Mr. Davidson, 200.&nbsp; Mr. Horne was
renominated; but a caveat being entered against this election,
the case came on for adjudication before Dr. Phillimore, in the
Archdeacon&rsquo;s Court, on May 30th, 1854, who declared the
election null, in consequence of the rejection of the votes of
certain parishioners; and a new election taking place on June
15th, the same gentlemen were again nominated, and, after a poll
of two days&rsquo; duration, the result was declared to
be&mdash;for Mr. Westerton, 651; Mr. Davidson, 323.&nbsp; 1855,
April 10, W. H. Jackson, Esq.; Charles Westerton: and the same
gentlemen still fill the office.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">All Saints&rsquo;
Church</span>.&mdash;This handsome edifice was consecrated by the
late Bishop Blomfield on Saturday, July 21st, 1849.&nbsp; It was
erected to supply a very great want, for previously <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>this isolated
portion of St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish was destitute of a place
of worship for the members of the Church of England.&nbsp; Within
the last twenty years the population has vastly increased; and
houses of first-class character have covered the nursery-grounds
and fields formerly abounding.</p>
<p>All Saints&rsquo; Church was erected from the designs of Mr.
Vulliamy, in the Lombardic or Byzantine style of architecture,
and when completed will be one of the most original and striking
edifices in London.&nbsp; It consists of a nave, and side aisles,
divided by pillars polished to imitate marble, terminating in an
apse, forming the chancel, and the roof of which is a blue ground
spangled with gold.&nbsp; Galleries are erected round three
sides; in the western one is a very fine organ.&nbsp; The roof is
open, of woodwork, and harmonises pleasingly with the other parts
of the building, although comparatively plain.</p>
<p>A tower at the west end, and a suitable enclosure before the
entrance, yet remain to be accomplished, ere the work of
completion is done.&nbsp; The estimated cost of these works
amounts to &pound;2,100; and it is to be hoped that <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>the
necessary funds may not be long forthcoming, to hinder their
commencement.</p>
<p>The minister is the Rev. William Harness, known for his
edition of Shakspeare and other contributions to current
literature; and the senior curate is the Rev. Mackenzie Walcot,
whose &ldquo;Memorials of Westminster,&rdquo; and other works on
the ancient city, have rendered him its most popular and pleasing
historian.</p>
<p>Charles R. Harford and James Baber, Esqs., were the first
chosen churchwardens, and filled the office continuously till the
present year, when W. Aldridge, Esq., was instituted in room of
Mr. Harford.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Albert Gate</span> occupies an arched
surface over the bed of the Westbourne, which was here open and
crossed by two bridges, one just within the Park, and erected
about 1734; the other, the old bridge from which our Hamlet is
named.&nbsp; On its west side was the &ldquo;Fox and Bull;&rdquo;
on its east a low court of very old houses, named after the
&ldquo;White Hart,&rdquo; which, with these other buildings and
the Cannon Brewhouse, were entirely removed by authority of an
Act of Parliament (4 Vict., c. 12) passed March 10th, 1841, which
empowered the Commissioners <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>of Works to purchase the land on
which these tenements stood and the buildings thereon, for the
purpose of forming a new entrance to Hyde Park.&nbsp;
Accordingly, these improvements were carried out, and the iron <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>gates,
which are of a very chaste design, were fixed August 9th,
1845.&nbsp; The two stags on the side pedestals formerly
performed the same watch and ward at the Ranger&rsquo;s Lodge in

<p>Part of the ground bought by the commissioners they leased for
ninety-nine years to Mr. Thomas Cubitt, who immediately built on
the eastern side a large mansion, for which it is said Mr.
Hudson, M.P., paid him &pound;15,000.&nbsp; It is now the
residence of the French Ambassador: here our Queen paid a visit
in state on May 12, 1854; and the Emperor Napoleon held a Levee
on his visit to her in May, 1855.</p>
<p>This house was at first the butt of the London wits, who named
it Gibraltar House, affirming it would <i>never be
taken</i>.&nbsp; This opinion did not deter Mr. Cubitt from
erecting another, now the London and County Bank Branch; and a
third is now nearly finished for Captain Layland.&nbsp;
Architecturally, there is nothing in these mansions to admire,
notwithstanding the arrogance with which they force
attention.&nbsp; Though so gigantic, they are not imposing; of an
unusual altitude, they are destitute of <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>ornament,
and can only be likened to some &ldquo;tall bullies,&rdquo;
determined even in vulgarity to lord over their fellows.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Brompton Road</span>: a row of houses
built about twenty years since on the garden of Grosvenor
House.&nbsp; The National School House attached to Brompton
Church was built in 1841, in the Tudor style, from designs by Mr.
George Godwin.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ennismore Place</span> and <span
class="smcap">Terrace</span>, built by Elger on land belonging to
the Earl of Listowel, from whose second title the name is
derived; commenced in 1848, and finished in 1855.&nbsp; Along the
curve at the bottom of the Terrace (now called Princes Terrace)
the boundary of St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish abuts on that of
Kensington.&nbsp; No. 11, Princes Terrace, is the residence of
Mr. Bonamy Price.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">High Road</span>: a heterogeneous row of
houses between the Green and Rutland Gate is so called.&nbsp;
They are built without any attempt at uniformity, and are
generally of a mean description.&nbsp; Parts of the western end
are now called Trevor Terrace, and South Place.&nbsp; The oldest
houses in the Hamlet are in High Road: Chatham House (why so
called I know <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>not), built in 1688, now a broker&rsquo;s, was for many
years a boarding-school, and originally surrounded by a
garden.&nbsp; Three doors beyond is an ancient inn, now known as
the &ldquo;Rose and Crown,&rdquo; but formerly the &ldquo;Oliver
Cromwell,&rdquo; and which has been licensed above three hundred
years.&nbsp; It is the oldest house in Knightsbridge, was
formerly its largest inn, and not improbably the house which
sheltered Wyatt, while his unfortunate Kentish followers rested
on the adjacent green.&nbsp; A tradition told by all old
inhabitants of the locality that Cromwell&rsquo;s body-guard was
once quartered here, is still very prevalent, and an inscription
to that effect was till lately painted in front of the house; <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a> and on an ornamental piece of
plaster-work was formerly emblazoned the great Protector&rsquo;s
coat-of-arms.&nbsp; Although I have not been able to find any
mention of this place in connection with the Civil War, or with
Cromwell, yet nothing is more certain <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>than that (as I have before noticed)
our neighbourhood was frequently the scene of skirmishes during
that contest, or more probable than that it should be so,
considering it was the main road from the west to the
capital.&nbsp; In 1647 the Parliament Army was encamped about
here, and Fairfax&rsquo;s head-quarters were for awhile at
Holland House; so also immediately before and after the fight at
Brentford.&nbsp; At all events, Mr. Corbould, the distinguished
painter, took this old inn as a subject; and &ldquo;The Old
Hostelrie at Knightsbridge,&rdquo; exhibited in 1849 at St.
George&rsquo;s Gallery, formed a pleasing and animating
picture.&nbsp; He laid the scene as early as 1497; and opposite
the inn stands a well, surmounted by a figure of St. George,
while beyond is the spacious green, the meandering stream, the
bridge over it, surmounted by an embattled tower; while still
further appears the old hospital and chapel.&nbsp; All this is
likely to be summarily condemned as the painter&rsquo;s fancy,
but it nevertheless proves that an interest in the place was not
confined to the lower orders alone.&nbsp; The house has of late
been much modernised, and in 1853 had a narrow escape from
destruction by fire; <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>but enough still remains in its
peculiar chimneys, oval-shaped windows, the low rooms, large yard
and extensive stabling, with the galleries above and office-like
places beneath, to testify to its antiquity and former
importance. <a name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Rising Sun&rdquo; was for many years the residence
of Major Eyre of the Volunteers.&nbsp; It is built of red brick,
and on the coping is the date 16&mdash;.&nbsp; There was formerly
much carved work about the rooms, but all has disappeared: a
plain, old-fashioned staircase still exists.&nbsp; It has not
been licensed above thirty years.</p>
<p>Trevor Terrace consists of but ten houses.&nbsp; At the last,
Mr. Pocock, the architect, resides.</p>
<p>At the corner of South Place, which contains only three
houses, is the celebrated floor-cloth manufactory belonging to
Mr. Baber.&nbsp; It was the earliest one ever established, and
first erected, in 1754, by Nathan Smith.&nbsp; The first block
used for patterns was cut by him, and is still preserved in the
factory.&nbsp; A woodcut of it is given in &ldquo;Dodd&rsquo;s
British Manufactures,&rdquo; where full particulars of the
process of this manufacture are given.&nbsp; In 1794 the building
was entirely destroyed by fire, but restored the <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>ensuing
year; the whole was rebuilt in 1824, and presents a remarkable
appearance from its great height.&nbsp; At the north end is a
clock, over which is placed a figure of Time cut in stone.</p>
<p>The adjoining house (No. 2) was formerly called the
&ldquo;Parsonage,&rdquo; because inhabited by the Rev. J. Gamble,
of Trinity Chapel.&nbsp; This gentleman was in 1796 appointed
Chaplain of the Forces, and in 1799 Rector of Alphamstone and
Bradwell-juxta-Mare, Essex.&nbsp; For many years also he was
private chaplain to the Duke of York, who generally attended his
ministry at the Chapel.&nbsp; Mr. Gamble was a Fellow of Pembroke
College, Cambridge, a very able preacher, and a highly popular
man.&nbsp; He died in this house July 27, 1811.</p>
<p>Of late years this unpretending house has gained a world-wide
celebrity, having been the residence of Edward Sterling, the
&ldquo;Thunderer of the Times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Sterling was born at Waterford on the 27th February,
1773.&nbsp; He entered Trinity College, Dublin, and qualifying
himself for the bar, was duly called thereto; when the Irish
Rebellion breaking out, in his twenty-fifth year, the barristers
resolved to raise a corps of volunteers; <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>and thus a
complete change in Sterling&rsquo;s career was commenced.&nbsp;
He fought at Vinegar Hill, and doubtless fought well.&nbsp; He
quitted the bar, joined the Cheshire Militia, whence he and his
company afterwards volunteered into the line.&nbsp; In 1805 the
regiment was disbanded, and he removed to Kaimes Castle, Bute,
where he cultivated a farm.&nbsp; Afterwards he went into Wales,
and was appointed Adjutant of the Glamorgan Militia; and in 1810
published a pamphlet on Military Reform.&nbsp; It was dedicated
to the Duke of Kent, and went through a second edition the
following year.</p>
<p>In 1812 he wrote a series of letters to the <i>Times</i>,
under the signature of &ldquo;Vetus,&rdquo; which were afterwards
collected and reprinted.&nbsp; In 1814 he was at Paris, and
witnessed the entry of Napoleon after his return from Elba.&nbsp;
He made the best of his way to London, which he never quitted as
a residence again.&nbsp; He resided at various places in the
suburbs, but ultimately settled at Knightsbridge, a more
congenial home with its military air; and from this modest nook
poured forth the able, torrent-like articles, which gained their
unknown author the title of the &ldquo;Thunderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>He
died here in the year 1847; his wife, the excellent mother of
John Sterling, died here also, on April 16th, 1843. <a
name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a></p>
<p>This house was also a home to John Sterling when in London;
and here Carlyle, Maurice, Mill, and other gifted men, visited
him.&nbsp; It is now the residence of his brother, Colonel
Sterling; and here also came, after his honourable campaign in
the Crimea, the brave Sir Colin Campbell, who for his services in
India was created Lord Clyde.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kent House</span>.&mdash;H.R.H. the Duke
of Kent, about fifty years ago, rented a small house, to which he
added till it attained its present size, and was named after him,
Kent House.&nbsp; He resided here but a few years.&nbsp; After
him, Lord George Seymour inhabited it; and in 1817 the Hon.
George Villiers resided here.&nbsp; He was next brother and
heir-presumptive to the second Earl of Clarendon, and held
several official employments.&nbsp; He married the Hon. Theresa
Parker, only daughter of John, first Lord Boringdon, and brother
of the Earl of Morley, and died at Kent House, March 21st, <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>1827,
leaving a numerous family, three of whom at least have attained a
high reputation, viz., the present Earl of Clarendon, the Hon. C.
P. Villiers, M.P. for Wolverhampton, and Lady Theresa Lewis,
author of &ldquo;The Friends and Contemporaries of Lord
Chancellor Clarendon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Kent House (divided now) reside Earl Morley, and Sir G. C.
Lewis, the late Chancellor of the Exchequer.&nbsp; He married
Lady Theresa (noticed above), relict of P. H. Lister, Esq., and
is author of many important historical and political works, some
of which were written in this house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Stratheden House</span>.&mdash;This was
many years the residence of a highly respected family named
Marsh.&nbsp; Charles Marsh, Esq., was a magistrate of the county,
and William Marsh was senior partner in the house of Marsh,
Graham, and Co., with which the forgeries of Fauntleroy were so
interwoven.&nbsp; In the misfortunes occasioned by this man Mr.
Marsh was innocently, but bitterly, involved.&nbsp; He was a very
public spirited man, and greatly respected in the locality.</p>
<p>Stratheden House was afterwards the residence of Francis
Bassett, Lord de Dunstanville.&nbsp; <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>He was created baronet for his
prompt heading of the Cornish miners, and bringing them to the
relief of Plymouth, when the combined fleets of France and Spain
cast anchor in the Sound in 1779.&nbsp; He sat in the House of
Commons many years, supporting Lord North, and afterwards Pitt,
by whom, in 1799, he was raised to the peerage.&nbsp; He
supported the Tory interest in the Upper House, and, though not a
prominent member, drew down on him the ire of the veteran
reformer, Cartwright.&nbsp; He died in 1835.</p>
<p>This mansion is now the town residence of Lord Campbell and
Lady Stratheden, after whom it is named.&nbsp; The first volume
of the &ldquo;Lives of the Chancellors&rdquo; is dated from this
house.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">High Row</span> extends from Albert Gate
Houses to the Barracks; part of it, in an absurd spirit of
sycophancy, is now called Albert Terrace.&nbsp; At the west side
of the stream, till the improvements were effected, stood a
celebrated inn, known as the &ldquo;Fox and Bull,&rdquo;
traditionally said to have been founded in the time of Elizabeth,
and used by her on her visits to Lord Burleigh at Brompton.&nbsp;
Its curious sign is said to be the only one of the <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>kind
existing.&nbsp; At the &ldquo;Fox and Bull&rdquo; for a long
while was maintained that Queen Anne style of society, where
persons of &ldquo;parts&rdquo; and reputation were to be met with
in rooms open to all.&nbsp; A Captain Corbet was for a long while
its head; a Mr. Shaw, of the War Office, supplied the <i>London
Gazette</i>; and W. Harris, of Covent Garden Theatre, his
play-bills. <a name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a>&nbsp; Sir Joshua Reynolds is said to
have occasionally been a visitor, as also Sir W. Wynn, the patron
of Ryland; and George Morland frequently so.&nbsp; The sign was
once painted by Sir Joshua, and hung till 1807, when it was blown
down and destroyed in a storm.&nbsp; The house is referred to in
the &ldquo;Tatler,&rdquo; No. 259.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Fox and Bull&rdquo; was for many years the
receiving house of the Royal Humane Society; <a
name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"
class="citation">[112b]</a> and here was brought the poor frame
of the first wife of the poet Shelley, who had drowned herself in
the Serpentine.&nbsp; She had lodged in Hans Place, a short time
before, and was known to the landlord&rsquo;s daughter, Miss Mary
Ann Phillips; hence, her remains were treated <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>&ldquo;tenderly,&rdquo; and laid out &ldquo;with
care.&rdquo;&nbsp; An inquest was held, and a verdict returned,
which saved her the revolting burial then awarded to the
suicide.</p>
<p>A magistrate used to sit here once a-week: the last was Mr.
Bond, of Sloane Street.&nbsp; The present is the third house that
has existed under the same sign.&nbsp; The first was undoubtedly
of Elizabethan build; most of its rooms were panelled and carved,
with ornamented ceilings, &amp;c.; and it was not till 1799 that
the immense fire-places and dog-irons were removed for
stoves.&nbsp; This house was pulled down about 1836, and the
second immediately built on its site; this stood till the
alterations at Albert Gate made necessary the removal of the
business to its present situation.</p>
<p>In 1809 the landlord, digging to form a grain pit for his
cows, discovered six entire male skeletons, supposed to be
remains of some who had been slain (perhaps attempting to cross
the bridge) in the Civil War.</p>
<p>The Cannon Brewhouse, a large unsightly brick building,
occupied the remainder of the site of the Albert Gate
houses.&nbsp; Formerly here stood a row of mean dwellings, with
open cellars <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>in front, and at the west end a filthy court.&nbsp;
They were all removed for the brewhouse, the first stone of which
was laid by the late Mr. James Goding, on April 10th, 1804; at
the top was a huge wooden cannon. <a name="citation114"></a><a
href="#footnote114" class="citation">[114]</a>&nbsp; In 1841 the
whole was pulled down, and for ten years the ground was
unoccupied; in 1851 a temporary building for the Chinese
Collection of Mr. Dunn was erected, which in 1852 made way for
the large mansion not yet entirely finished.</p>
<p>The house now inhabited by Mr. Murray was, rather more than
thirty years since, the residence of Lady Ann Hamilton&mdash;the
faithful attendant of Caroline of Brunswick.&nbsp; Afterwards Mr.
Chalon, and then Mr. Davis, both artists of repute, inhabited
it.&nbsp; To Mr. Davis succeeded Mr. White, a naturalist, who had
here a large collection of wild beasts and birds.&nbsp; I have
heard he was tutor to Van Amburgh.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodburn, when living supposed to be the first judge in
matters relating to ancient art, once lived in this house.&nbsp;
He died in 1854.&nbsp; <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>The staircases still bear proof of
the residence of these artists here.</p>
<p>Captain Corbet, a comrade of St. Vincent, lived at No. 19;
Ozias Humphry at 13; Maurice Morgann, opposite Sloane Street,
John Taylor, the singer, Paul Bedford (for several years at 18),
Mr. Justice Burton, and Mr. McCarthy, the sculptor, at
17&mdash;were all residents of High Row.&nbsp; Of these, Humphry
will be noticed here.&nbsp; He was born at Honiton in 1742; and
early evincing a taste for drawing, was taken from the Grammar
School of his native town and sent to London, where he prosecuted
his studies most assiduously.&nbsp; Having, after two
years&rsquo; stay, been compelled to return through the death of
his father, he engaged himself to Mr. Collins, a miniature
painter at Bath.&nbsp; But in 1763, by the advice of Reynolds, he
returned to London, and was brought under public notice through
his auspices.&nbsp; For some years he practised with increasing
success, and in 1773 set out for Italy with Romney; he returned
in September, 1777, and his fame rapidly increased.&nbsp;
Miniatures he had chiefly devoted himself to, but now he turned
to full-portrait painting, to <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>which Hayley in his poem addressed
to Romney refers:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thy graces, Humphry, and thy colours
clear,<br />
From miniatures&rsquo; small circle disappear:<br />
May their distinguished merit still prevail,<br />
And shine with lustre on the larger scale.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1785 he sailed for India; but the climate compelling him to
return before he had attained his object, he, in 1789, again
exhibited in London, confirming his former reputation, and next
year he was elected R.A.&nbsp; He was employed to paint a series
of original portraits of the Sackvilles by the Duke of Dorset;
but ere he had completed them his sight failed him, and though
various attempts were made to pursue his art, they were
unsuccessful, and he was compelled to terminate his professional
career.</p>
<p>Humphry was held in high estimation by some of the greatest
men of his time; by Reynolds, Hastings, and Sir W. Jones.&nbsp;
He is one of the heroes, too, of Boswell&rsquo;s inimitable
biography: Johnson placed under his care his godson, &ldquo;a son
of Mr. Paterson, eminent for his knowledge of books.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As an artist, though he suffered many disadvantages, he ranked
high; as a man of moral worth, and kind affections, he was
&ldquo;zealous in good offices, <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>and strenuous in his efforts for
rising genius;&rdquo; and it was to him Dr. Walcot first
introduced Opie.</p>
<p>Besides the poetic niche of Hayley, Owen Cambridge mentions
him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But, Humphry, by whom shall your labours be
told,<br />
How your colours enliven the young and the old?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Cumberland likewise&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Crown&rsquo;d with fresh roses, grateful
Humphry stands,<br />
While beauty grows immortal from his hands.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Humphry resided several years in Knightsbridge; he died at 13,
High Row, March 9th, 1810, and was buried in St. James&rsquo;
Chapel ground, Hampstead Road. <a name="citation117"></a><a
href="#footnote117" class="citation">[117]</a></p>
<p>Out of the High Row runs Mills&rsquo; Buildings, so called
from a builder of that name who erected them in 1777.&nbsp; At
the top, abutting on the Park, is Park Row: at No. 5, Mr. Thomas
Cooper for several years resided; and Mr. F. Matthews once lived
in this row.</p>
<p>The spot of ground now occupied by the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s stables, just erected from designs by
Hardwick, was purchased by the <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Duke from a Mr. Williams, whose
freehold property it was.&nbsp; Several houses in Park Place, the
&ldquo;Nag&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; <a name="citation118"></a><a
href="#footnote118" class="citation">[118]</a> and five other
houses, were removed for these stables.&nbsp; Two of them touched
on the Park, and were called Williams&rsquo; Cottages.</p>
<p>At the west end of High Row is the barrack for the
Horse-Guards, an extensive range of brick buildings, built in
1795, and capable of accommodating 600 men and 500 horses.&nbsp;
In the centre of the chief building is an oblong parade, around
which are the apartments for the men, and the chief stabling for
the horses.&nbsp; A mansion for the officers, riding school,
&amp;c., stand at the western end.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hyde Park</span>.&mdash;Of the glories of
Hyde Park it is almost superfluous to speak; it has been a place
of great popular resort since the days of Charles II.&nbsp; It
was then visited, not as now, for air and exercise only, but was
much used by the citizens for their sports.&nbsp; May 1st, 1654,
a great hurling match was played before the Lord Protector.&nbsp;
We read that on that day also &ldquo;great resort came to Hyde
Park, many hundreds of rich coaches, and gallants in attire; <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>but most
shameful powdered-hair men and painted and spotted
women.&rdquo;&nbsp; Horse and footraces were also held
here.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we make a fling to London, and see how
the spring appears there in Spring Garden, and in Hyde Park to
see the races, horse and foot?&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;Merry
Beggars, or Jovial Crew,&rdquo; 1641.)</p>
<p>Many and famous have been the reviews here, some of them of
deep historical interest.&nbsp; In October, 1803, as
before-mentioned, George III. reviewed the different Volunteer
Corps raised by the metropolis, when the total number inspected
amounted to 27,077 men, of whom our local contingent mustered in
force of 124.&nbsp; The enthusiasm created by the appearance of
the Guards on their return from the Crimea, and the first
distribution of the Victoria Cross by her Majesty in person, are
fresh in the public memory.</p>
<p>It is well diversified with wood and water; the Serpentine in
its space amply supplying the latter.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Well may the coyest of the Nine<br />
Be proud to sing the Serpentine;<br />
For never breeze has swept, nor beam<br />
Shed light upon a luckier stream.<br />
&rsquo;Tis but a brook, whose scanty source,<br />
Hard by, just struggles in its course,<br />
<a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>But
scarce has reached, slow trickling thence,<br />
The bounds of royal influence,<br />
When, such the favour and protection<br />
That flows from interest and connection,<br />
&rsquo;Tis bidden a nobler form to take,<br />
And spreads and widens to a lake.&rdquo; <a
name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a"
class="citation">[120a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would that its waters were kept sweet and pure; how much more
enjoyable would its ride and walks be.&nbsp; Life at the
Serpentine in the height of the London season, and after a few
days&rsquo; sharp frost, presents characteristics that can be
seen in the metropolis only.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hyde Park river, which no
river is,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Serpentine&mdash;which is not
serpentine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When frozen, every skater claims as his,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In right of common, there to
entertwine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With countless crowds, and glide upon the ice.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lining the banks, the timid and
unwilling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stand and look on, while some the fair entice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By telling, yonder skaters are
quadrilling;<br />
And here the skateless hire the &ldquo;<i>best</i> skates&rdquo;
for a shilling. <a name="citation120b"></a><a
href="#footnote120b" class="citation">[120b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the Serpentine is at these two seasons productive of so
much enjoyment, so it is also at the same time the source of much
danger.&nbsp; The skater, the bather, and he who is sick of
life&rsquo;s miseries, too often afford employment for the staff
at the Receiving House of the Royal Humane Society.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>This
edifice was erected on its north bank in 1834.&nbsp; One devoted
to the same purpose had previously occupied the same spot.&nbsp;
In it are beds, warm baths, tables, and apparatus of all kinds
for the restoration of those apparently drowned, in the hope that
&ldquo;perchance a spark may be concealed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Every
effort of science is here exercised on the cases requiring such
attentions; the inspection of the public is invited by a notice
to that effect affixed outside.</p>
<p>Some little distance north and west of the Receiving House,
formerly stood a very ancient edifice, known by the name of
&ldquo;The Cake House;&rdquo; it was built with timber and
plaster, and roofed with flat tiles.&nbsp; It was a place for the
sale of refreshments to those who visited the park&mdash;hence
its name.&nbsp; Pepys says, April 25th, 1669:&mdash;&ldquo;Abroad
with my wife in the afternoon to the Park, where very much
company, and the weather very pleasant.&nbsp; I carried my wife
to the Lodge the first time this year; and there in our coach eat
a cheesecake, and drank a tankard of milk.&rdquo;&nbsp; We may
imagine by the following that it was the best known and more
visited than any other spot in the Park:&mdash;&ldquo;Comely!
nay, &rsquo;tis no London female; <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>she&rsquo;s a thing that never saw
cheesecake, tart, or syllabub, at the Lodge in Hyde
Park.&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;The English Monsieur,&rdquo; by the
Hon. James Howard.&nbsp; 4to. 1674.)</p>

</a></p>
<p>Adjacent to this old Lodge was the famous Ring, where the
racing and other amusements were carried on; and where the ground
was often dyed with the blood of the duellist.</p>
<p>The Ring, or parts of it, can still be distinctly traced on
the east of the Ranger&rsquo;s Grounds.&nbsp; Here fell the Duke
of Hamilton, after his duel with the Lord Mohun.&nbsp; Swift, in
his journal to Stella, Nov. 15th, 1712, says, &ldquo;The <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Duke was
helped towards the Cake House, by the Ring, in Hyde Park (where
the duel was fought), and died on the grass, before he could
reach the house:&rdquo; a graphic picture, and a sad one, of that
fashionable and cruel custom now happily abolished in this
country.&nbsp; The journals a century ago were replete with
notices of duels fought in the Ring in Hyde Park.</p>
<p>Turn we now from these painful reminiscences.&nbsp; From the
Ring, we have in view the costly toy of George IV., the Marble
Arch, which, for want of a better destination, was removed to
Cumberland Gate from Buckingham Palace; it was designed by Nash,
after the arch of Constantine at Rome, and originally was
intended to have been surmounted with a chariot and horses, and
afterwards with a classic equestrian statue of his Majesty; this
was actually executed by Chantry at a cost of 9,000 guineas, but
it never reached its intended elevation, and now occupies the
pedestal at the north-east corner of Trafalgar Square.&nbsp;
Perhaps the most satisfactory work of art in connection with the
structure is the very beautiful pair of gates.&nbsp; They are
said to be the <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>largest in Europe; are designed in scroll, having six
openings, two filled with St. George and the Dragon, two with the
royal cypher G.R., and two with lions <i>passant gardant</i>;
they cost 3,000 guineas, and are cast in an alloy composed
largely of copper.</p>
<p>At present the erection produces a somewhat poor effect, but
it is not fair to criticise it, seeing that its original design
has not been carried out; were it surmounted with a
well-harmonised group, as at first intended, no doubt its
appearance would have been much more imposing.</p>
<p>We have in the Park, just within the entrance at the
&ldquo;Corner,&rdquo; the statue of Achilles, cast from cannon
taken from the French, erected in honour of the late Duke of
Wellington, by a subscription of his &ldquo;Countrywomen,&rdquo;
as told by the inscription thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">To

<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>We
give a passing reference to Rotten Row, where, every evening
during the season, may be seen one of the most animating and
national spectacles of the metropolis; the fine gravelly road is
then filled with equestrians of both sexes mounted on the most
beautiful horses, and parading up and down to the admiration of
the lounging spectators, whiling away their evening hour on the
seats or rails skirting the road.&nbsp; This road has lately been
injudiciously widened, being unused some eight months in the
year, and the crossing thereby rendered the more dangerous the
remaining four.</p>
<p>It is needless to speak here of the Great Exhibition of 1851:
these pages are not to tell of its beauties, its results, or the
enthusiasm it called into play; suffice it to say that our dear
old Park was the scene of its glories.&nbsp; We will hope that
its peaceful memories may never be effaced from among the
nations.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Hyde Park Corner</span>.&mdash;The
earliest mention of this name I have met with is in the
&ldquo;Chronicle of Queen Mary,&rdquo; &amp;c., published by the
Camden Society, where Wyatt is described planting his
&ldquo;ordenance over agaynst <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>the parke corner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
name properly applies to that triangularly-shaped portion of the
Park formed by the line from Stanhope Gate to Apsley House.&nbsp;
Several interesting incidents have occurred at this spot
deserving notice.&nbsp; Here James I., in March, 1606, was met by
his whole court and the House of Commons, with the Speaker at
their head, to welcome him on his safe return from a hunting
excursion near Woking, where it was stated he had been
murdered.&nbsp; Here, in 1625, Judge Whitelock sat on the grass
which grew in the road, and with his retinue ate the dinner
brought with them from the country, afraid to stay longer in
London than absolutely necessary, the plague having just carried
off thousands of people.&nbsp; After his meal, he galloped to
Westminster Hall, adjourned the courts, and quickly retired.</p>
<p>By this road, on August 6th, 1647, Fairfax and his army, all
with a laurel branch in their hats, entered from Kensington,
accompanied by the House of Commons, to go to Westminster, the
matter of the Declaration having been agreed to.&nbsp; From
Kensington to the fort here, a guard stood three feet deep; and
at Hyde Park Corner they were met by the Lord Mayor and <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>Corporation, come to congratulate them on their
arrival.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lieut. General Cromwell&rsquo;s regiment of
horse&rdquo; was among them, we are told: this was not his last
appearance here.&nbsp; When he returned from his Irish campaign,
Fairfax and others met him at Hounslow; and as he approached,
Colonel Barkstead&rsquo;s regiment, drawn up in the highway at
the Park Corner, saluted him.&nbsp; In the journal of George Fox,
the Quaker, too, is an anecdote of his meeting the Protector
here.</p>
<p>After the fight at Brentford, consternation being felt by the
Londoners at the near approach of the Royal Army, a chain of
forts was thrown up by the citizens, connected with each other by
means of earth works and ramparts.&nbsp; Whitelock says it was
wonderful to see how the women and children, and vast numbers of
people, would come and work at digging and carrying earth to the
fortifications.&nbsp; The newspapers of the day teem with curious
particulars of the prevailing excitement; one day we read of five
thousand felt-makers, another of four thousand porters, then of
five thousand shoemakers, and six thousand tailors, all to assist
in the pressing work.&nbsp; Nor were the fair <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>sex
behindhand; Butler, in his &ldquo;Hudibras,&rdquo; alluding to
this, says they</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;March&rsquo;d rank and file, with drum and
ensign<br />
T&rsquo; intrench the city for defence in,<br />
Raised rampiers with their own soft hands<br />
To put the enemy to stands;<br />
From ladies down to oyster-wenches,<br />
Labour&rsquo;d like pioneers in trenches;<br />
Fall&rsquo;n to their pickaxes and tools,<br />
And helped the men to dig like moles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Nash, in a note on this passage, says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Ladies Middlesex, Foster, Anne Waller, and
Mrs. Dunch, were particularly remarkable for their
activity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of these forts stood on the brow of the <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>hill at
Hyde Park Corner; it was a large one, consisting of four
bastions, commanding the ascent and the adjoining fields.&nbsp;
Four years afterwards&mdash;no further use remaining for
them&mdash;the House of Commons ordered their removal.</p>
<p>Dr. King relates an interesting anecdote of Charles II.
meeting his brother James at this spot, on his return from a
hunting excursion, and escorted by a party of the Guards.&nbsp;
Charles, who was out for a stroll in the Park, of which he was
very fond, was attended by but two of his Court.&nbsp; The Guards
recognising the King, halted; and James being acquainted with the
cause thereof, stepped from his coach, and saluted his brother,
but expressed his surprise to meet him there almost unattended,
and thought he exposed himself to some danger.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
kind of danger, James,&rdquo; replied Charles, &ldquo;for I am
sure no man in England will take away my life to make you
king.&rdquo; <a name="citation129"></a><a href="#footnote129"
class="citation">[129]</a></p>
<p>Respecting this interesting anecdote, a tradition tells us
that Charles II. was very partial to a walk in Hyde Park, and
that at the spot to which he limited himself generally he <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>planted two
acorns from the Boscobel Tree.&nbsp; The trees from them grew at
the north side of the Serpentine, just where the road turns off
by the magazine towards Bayswater.&nbsp; For many years they were
fenced in, but one only now remains; the other, much decayed, was
removed in 1854.</p>

<p>Hyde Park Corner is now the most magnificent entrance to the
metropolis; the entrances to the Parks, Apsley House, and, in the
background, the glorious towers of Westminster, <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>form a
scene at once imposing and national.&nbsp; Formerly the entrance
was very mean; a turnpike blocked the way, and instead of the
classic archways, paltry lodges and iron gates led to the
parks.&nbsp; Between the lodge and park side was a dead wall,
eight feet high, built in the reign of Charles II., but removed
in 1828.&nbsp; The toll-house was sold by auction, October 4th,
1825, and cleared away immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The existing entrance to Hyde Park was completed in 1828, from
designs of Mr. Decimus Burton; the frieze was designed by
Archibald Henning; the ironwork by Bramah.&nbsp; The Triumphal
Arch leading to Constitution Hill was built about the same time;
its beautiful gates were likewise the work of Bramah.</p>
<p>From Hyde Park Corner the distances to the west are measured;
a standard stood near to Apsley House till about 1827.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kensington Gore</span> was, as before
shown, originally called Kyngsgore&mdash;firstly, because it
belonged to the king; and secondly, from its peculiar shape;
gore, an old English word, meaning &ldquo;a narrow slip of
land,&rdquo; according to <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>the old glossaries.&nbsp; In Kent,
the peasantry call a triangularly-shaped piece of ground a gore;
and seamstresses use the word in a similar manner to the present
day, to express a gusset or piece of stuff let into their
work.&nbsp; The early history of the Gore in connection with
Kilburn Priory has been noticed; and here its modern story must
be told.&nbsp; From Prince Albert&rsquo;s Road to Noel House is
generally now considered as the Gore.</p>
<p>Brompton Park Nursery was established during the reign of
Charles II.&nbsp; During the greater part of the seventeenth
century the land appears to have belonged to the Percivals,
ancestors of the Earl of Egmont.&nbsp; Philip Percival, the
friend of Pym and Hollis, was born here in 1603.&nbsp; Brompton
Park appears to have extended from what is now called Cromwell
Road to the road from Knightsbridge to Kensington.&nbsp; Various
properties were cut out of it; but the Percivals were here at
least till 1675.&nbsp; Soon after this date about sixty acres
appear to have been formed into a nursery garden, the first ever
established in this country.&nbsp; It early excited great
attention, more particularly about 1690&ndash;1700, when it
belonged <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>to George London and Henry Wise, the most celebrated
gardeners of the time.&nbsp; Evelyn, in his &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo;
records, on April 24th, 1694, taking &ldquo;Mr. Waller to see
Brompton Park, where he was in admiration at the store of rare
plants, and the method he found in that noble nursery, and how
well it was cultivated.&rdquo;&nbsp; Evelyn again alludes to the
nursery in his &ldquo;Sylva,&rdquo; declaring that the
&ldquo;sight&rdquo; of it &ldquo;gave an idea of something
greater&rdquo; than he could express.&nbsp; He speaks highly of
the skill and industry here shown, and says the like is not to be
met with in this or any other country.&nbsp; Bowack, writing in
1705, affirms that if the plants were valued but at one penny
each, they would be worth above &pound;40,000.</p>
<p>Messrs. London and Wise translated from the French &ldquo;The
Complete Gardener,&rdquo; published in 1701.&nbsp; They were
gardeners to William III.; and Kensington Gardens were laid out
by them.&nbsp; Wise also superintended the laying-out of Hampton
Court; and Evelyn mentions visiting him there.&nbsp; After them,
the establishment went through various hands; but when the
surrounding fields were built on, the smoke injured the plants;
and the railways <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>bringing up fruit and vegetables cheaper than they
could be brought to perfection at here, the business gradually
diminished, and in 1853 entirely ceased.</p>
<p>Along an ancient wall separating the grounds from those of
Cromwell House, a valuable collection of vines was planted, which
were cultivated with great success.&nbsp; This wall, the contents
of the gardens, and the dwellings therein, were cleared away in
1855.&nbsp; The following list of owners is chiefly taken from
Faulkner:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. James Gray, who was chief partner in this concern so long,
died at Brompton in 1849.&nbsp; He is mentioned with respect in
Faulkner&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Park House, a plain but spacious mansion, pulled down in 1856,
adjoined Princes Gate.&nbsp; It was divided from the road by a
brick wall, part of that ancient one just mentioned, for this
house stood within Brompton Park: hence its name.&nbsp; Probably
a more ancient mansion stood <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>here; but the late one was for many
years the seat of the Veres, bankers of the city of London.&nbsp;
Afterwards it became the residence of William Evans, Esq., M.P.,
soon after whose death it was sold.</p>
<p>Eden Lodge was the residence of Lord Auckland,
Governor-General of India.&nbsp; Here he retired after his
return, and died in 1849.</p>
<p>Mercer Lodge, a small brick residence, was inhabited by Frank
Marryat, son of the novelist, and himself an author of one or two
books of travel.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Mayhew now resides here.</p>
<p>Immediately adjoining is a row of five houses, called
emphatically Kensington Gore.&nbsp; All are faced with white
stucco, are very small, and appear as if intended for the lodge
of some great mansion never erected.&nbsp; Two of them, which
seem to contain but one room, have, however, second storeys at
the back, and good gardens, which, with the Park in front, render
them very pleasant residences.&nbsp; At one of these houses, in
1816, Mrs. Inchbald inquired after some lodgings which were to
let.&nbsp; The landlady was too fine a personage for the writer
of &ldquo;The Simple Story,&rdquo; and so exacting in her demands
that her applicant indignantly <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>wended her way elsewhere.&nbsp; No.
2, now called Hamilton Lodge, was once the occasional residence
of John Wilkes.&nbsp; The house was kept by Mrs. Arnold, mother
of his second daughter Harriett, who married Mr. Serjeant Rough,
afterwards an Indian judge.&nbsp; Wilkes sometimes had high
visitors here: Mr. Leigh Hunt quotes a memorandum of his,
regarding a dinner here to Counts Woronzow and Nesselrode; and if
we are to set down Sir Philip Francis as Junius, here Junius
visited, as Mrs. Rough said, frequently; and when a child he once
cut off a lock of her hair.&nbsp; Wilkes to the last walked hence
to the city, attired in his scarlet and buff suit, with a cocked
hat and rosette, and military boots, a dress authorised by his
position as colonel of militia.&nbsp; The urn over the doorway
Mr. Leigh Hunt imagines to have been placed there by him as an
indication of his classic taste, and the supposition is most
probably correct.&nbsp; No. 5 was the residence for awhile of
Count D&rsquo;Orsay.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gore House</span>.&mdash;In 1808, Mr.
Wilberforce took this mansion (which had previously been the
residence of a Government contractor) for his home.&nbsp; He
found it, he says, more salubrious <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>than his house at Clapham; and
writes further, &ldquo;We are just one mile from the turnpike at
Hyde Park Corner, having about three acres of pleasure-ground
around our house, or rather behind it, and several old trees,
walnut and mulberry, of thick foliage.&nbsp; I can sit and read
under their shade, with as much admiration of the beauties of
nature as if I were two hundred miles from the great
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he passed many years of his happy and
useful life, his house the resort of those men who awoke our land
from the deadly torpor into which years of fearful warfare had
plunged it.&nbsp; Here came Clarkson, Zachary Macaulay, Romilly,
and others, to commune together on those measures which, to quote
Channing, brought about &ldquo;the most signal expression
afforded by our times of the progress of civilisation and a purer
Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilberforce was exceedingly partial to Gore House, and his
friends appear to have always found a ready home within it.&nbsp;
In 1814, Mr. Henry Thornton, for many years M.P. for Southwark,
and one of his most earnest supporters, came here for the benefit
of the air and medical aid.&nbsp; He lingered a few weeks, <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>and died
here January 17th, 1815, aged fifty-three.&nbsp; Isaac Milner,
too, an early friend, who came to London to attend the Board of
Longitude, died here after five weeks&rsquo; illness, on April
1st, 1820.</p>
<p>The following year Wilberforce quitted Gore House.&nbsp; He
retired to Marden, in Surrey, a lovely spot and an interesting
locality; but he regretted leaving</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The still retreats that soothed his
tranquil breast,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and often in after years alludes to his old home, its
associations, and his &ldquo;Kensington Gore
breakfasts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great is the contrast Gore House next presents: strange are
the mutabilities of a metropolitan mansion.&nbsp; After the
philanthropist, a few unknown persons held the place ere the next
celebrity, one of a totally opposite character, reigned.&nbsp;
Lady Blessington&mdash;for to her allusion is made&mdash;came
here in 1836; and the opposition of ideas called forth by such
persons seems to have suggested to James Smith his</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">GORE HOUSE: AN
IMPROMPTU.</p>
<p>Mild Wilberforce, by all beloved,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Once own&rsquo;d this hallow&rsquo;d spot,<br />
Whose zealous eloquence improved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fetter&rsquo;d Negro&rsquo;s lot;<br />
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Yet here
still slavery attacks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Blessington invites:<br />
The chains from which he freed the Blacks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She rivets on the Whites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Blessington came to Gore House in 1836; and the brilliant
circle which thronged around her in Seamore Place was increased
with the greater capabilities of the new residence.&nbsp; Haydon,
writing February 27th, 1835, says, &ldquo;Everybody goes to Lady
Blessington&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She has the first news of everything,
and everybody seems delighted to tell her.&nbsp; She is the
centre of more talent and gaiety than any woman of fashion in
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; To Gore House came novelists and dramatists,
artists and actors, statesmen and refugees.&nbsp; Here Louis
Napoleon, just escaped from captivity at Ham, first came for the
shelter of an English roof; and afterwards&mdash;deep lesson
too&mdash;a few years later she went forth as privately perhaps
as her guest had entered, from the palace of which she had been
Queen, to seek in the capital of him whom she had harboured, that
support she had so freely bestowed on him; the late refugee then
having an empire rapidly falling into his hands; her object was
not gained, and on this occasion &ldquo;hope left a wretched one
that sought <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>her.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Blessington finally quitted Gore
House April 14th, 1849.</p>
<p>Marguerite, Countess of Blessington, was daughter of Edmund
Power, a coarse, unfeeling squire of Tipperary.&nbsp; She was
born September 1st, 1790, and at fifteen married to a Captain
Farmer, as brutal a character as her father.&nbsp; They separated
in 1807, and he, compelled to go to India, died there.</p>
<p>Being denied a home under her father&rsquo;s roof, she for
some years lived in seclusion and study, but becoming acquainted
with the Earl of Blessington, married him in February,
1818.&nbsp; Then another phase of her life commenced, and their
mansion in St. James&rsquo;s Square was the resort of the most
fashionable of the day.&nbsp; Her beauty at this time was very
great, and afforded a theme for the pen of Byron, and the pencil
of Sir Thomas Lawrence.&nbsp; With the poet she became acquainted
during her well-known continental tour, during which the
introduction to D&rsquo;Orsay also took place.&nbsp; Lord
Blessington dying at Paris in 1825, his widow remained there till
after the Revolution of 1830, when she returned to London.</p>
<p>Connected with the story of Lady Blessington, <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>that of
Count D&rsquo;Orsay is intimately woven.&nbsp; He was a great
favourite of Lord Blessington, whose daughter by his first wife
was, when quite a young girl, fetched from school to marry him;
and a promise also is said to have been given from the Count to
his Lordship, and from the Count&rsquo;s mother to Lady
Blessington, that they (the Count and her Ladyship) would never
leave each other.&nbsp; Be that as it may, they lived together
for above a quarter of a century, and increase of years seemed
still stronger to consolidate the engagement.&nbsp; D&rsquo;Orsay
led a gay and extravagant life in London, considerably beyond his
means, in great measure appearing to consider his patronage
sufficient payment.&nbsp; He undoubtedly possessed great
abilities, was an excellent artist, and a humourist of the first
water.&nbsp; But his conduct to his wife was cruel in the
extreme; she was spurned by him entirely; he still pocketing an
income from her father&rsquo;s estates!&nbsp; For a long time he
could only make his exit from Gore House on Sundays, for fear of
arrest, and his extravagancies vastly accelerated the day of
retribution.&nbsp; He and Lady Blessington retired to Paris, and
Gore House was stripped of its contents by <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>public
sale.&nbsp; There, whatever was the cause, they met not with the
reception anticipated.&nbsp; Lady Blessington died soon after, on
June 4th, 1849.&nbsp; D&rsquo;Orsay designed her monument, and in
little more than three years after his career was ended.&nbsp; He
died July 1st, 1852.</p>
<p>Gore House became, in 1851, Monsieur Soyer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Symposium for all Nations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here that
celebrated minister of the interior provided international
feasts, farewell banquets, &amp;c.; and various amusements in the
highly-decorated rooms conduced to the public pleasure.&nbsp; The
gardens were beautifully laid out and ornamented with sculpture,
while the interior testified to the industry and taste of Madame
Soyer in the art of painting.&nbsp; In February, 1852, all was
again dismantled, its <i>Baronial Hall</i> and <i>Encampment of
all Nations</i> being sold by auction.</p>
<p>Gore House was shortly afterwards purchased by the Royal
Commissioners of the Great Exhibition of 1851.&nbsp; The whole
estate comprised about twenty-one acres, added to which were
Gray&rsquo;s Nursery Grounds, Park House, and Grove House, and
various market-gardens, the grounds of Cromwell House, and <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>other lands
belonging to the Earl of Harrington and the Baron de
Villars.&nbsp; Acts of Parliament were passed legalising the
plans of the Commissioners, and in accordance various old
footpaths, &amp;c., were stopped, and houses removed.&nbsp; A
complete revolution has been effected, two magnificent roads
leading from the Gore to Cromwell Road at Brompton have been
formed, and at length Gore House itself was doomed.&nbsp; Its
materials were sold by lots on July 17th, 1857, and soon after
the building was removed.</p>
<p>Grove House, adjoining Gore House, was for many years the
residence of Lady Elizabeth Whitbread, widow of the celebrated
statesman.&nbsp; With Gore House it has, since 1852, been used
for schools and offices of the department of Science and Art.</p>
<p>Beyond this spot our description does not extend: the district
of All Saints and manor of Knightsbridge stretch much further,
but such parts have been already described by Mr. Faulkner.&nbsp;
Ere, however, I quite leave the Gore, it must be mentioned that,
among others, Carrington Bowles, the celebrated printseller, had
a house, and died here June 20th, 1793.&nbsp; <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>The Rev.
Thomas Clare, vicar of St. Bride&rsquo;s, Fleet Street, and an
author of some repute, also at one time resided here.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kinnerton Street</span> is so called from
an estate belonging to the Grosvenor family.&nbsp; Here is a
dissecting school and anatomical museum attached to St.
George&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Knightsbridge Green</span>, formed by the
junction of the Kensington and Fulham Roads, was formerly of
greater extent than at the present time.&nbsp; It was formerly
the village green in reality, and its last Maypole was preserved
as lately as 1800.&nbsp; At its east end was, till about 1835, a
watch-house and pound, and Addison, in a humorous paper in the
&ldquo;Spectator,&rdquo; alludes to it.&nbsp; Proposing to
satisfy by home news the craving for intelligence occasioned by
the just concluded war, he writes,&mdash;&ldquo;By my last
advices from Knightsbridge, I hear that a horse was clapped into
the pound on the third instant, and that he was not released when
the letters came away.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Spectator</i>, No.
142.)</p>
<p>The greater part of the Green is now covered by Middle Row, a
medley of very inferior houses.&nbsp; On the north side is an old
inn (rebuilt in 1851) called after the bluff Marquis of <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Granby.&nbsp; The soldier has been dethroned, and Sir
Joseph Paxton promoted in his stead.</p>
<blockquote><p>Vernon, the Butcher Cumberland, Wolfe, Hawke,<br

Howe,<br />
Evil and good, have had their tithe of talk,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And fill&rsquo;d the sign-posts
then as Wellesley now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>William Moffatt, who in conjunction with Frederick Wood,
surveyed London and published a valuable and clever map of the
levels thereof, lived at this time in Middle Row.&nbsp; His
coadjutor still lives (in indigent circumstances) in the
locality.</p>
<p>The small plot of ground railed in, is said, by a very general
tradition, to have been the spot where the victims of the plague
from the Lazar House and elsewhere in the hamlet were
buried.&nbsp; I have strong reasons for placing faith in this
tradition; and in 1808, some human remains found where now stands
William Street were buried here, it being considered the proper
spot for such.&nbsp; King&rsquo;s Row, built in 1785, has not a
cellar to a single house for this reason.&nbsp; At its end is a
detached brick building, the school-house of All Saints
district.</p>
<p>A market was held here till the beginning of the present
century for cattle every Thursday; <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>the last pen-posts were not removed
till 1850.&nbsp; A fair was also held here annually on July
31st.</p>
<p>Grosvenor House, which formed with Mr. Rogers&rsquo; premises
one tenement, was for many years the residence of the Gosling
family, who were for a long while connected with the
hamlet.&nbsp; Francis Gosling, Esq., an eminent banker, lived
here; he died February 25th, 1817.&nbsp; Bennett Gosling, Esq.,
his nephew, resided in Lowndes Square, where he died, May 12th,
1855.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Pakenham&rdquo; was built as the hotel for an
intended railway terminus.&nbsp; On its site was an old house,
many years the residence of Mr. Egg, the founder of the
well-known firm of gunsmiths in Piccadilly.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Knightsbridge Terrace</span> till within
the last five-and-twenty years had not a shop in it.&nbsp; Every
house was private, and had a deep basement area in front.&nbsp;
The corner house, now divided, was for many years Mr.
Telfair&rsquo;s &ldquo;College for the Deaf and
Dumb.&rdquo;&nbsp; James Telfair died in 1796, aged 84; his son,
Cortez Telfair, died April 23rd, 1816, aged 65.&nbsp; Both were
buried at Kensington, and in the church <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>is a tablet
to their memory.&nbsp; It states Cortez Telfair to have been
celebrated for his literary attainments; but what these were I
have not been able to learn, other than that, in 1775, he edited
&ldquo;The Town and Country Spelling Book.&rdquo; <a
name="citation147"></a><a href="#footnote147"

<p>In one of the houses immediately facing the Chapel resided for
many years Maurice Morgann, Esq., author of an &ldquo;Essay on
the Character of Falstaff,&rdquo; and Under-Secretary of State to
the first administration of Lord Shelburne.&nbsp; He was also
Secretary to the Embassy for ratifying the Peace with the United
States in 1783.</p>
<p>Besides his remarkable &ldquo;Essay on Falstaff,&rdquo; he
published &ldquo;Remarks on the Slave Trade,&rdquo; a useful and
earnest pamphlet.&nbsp; In the &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s
Magazine,&rdquo; December, 1815, a writer endeavoured to fix on
him the authorship of the &ldquo;Heroic Epistle to Sir William
Chambers,&rdquo; now known to have been concocted by Mason and
Walpole, but published under the pseudonyme of &ldquo;Malcolm
M&lsquo;Gregor, of Knightsbridge, Esq.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Dr.
Symmons, Morgann&rsquo;s <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>friend and executor, denied the
ownership, and declared his repeated injunctions were, that all
his papers should be destroyed, and that he never published any
but those with his name.&nbsp; Symmons had previously said,
&ldquo;Some of those writings destroyed, in the walks of
politics, metaphysics, and criticism, would have planted a
permanent laurel on his grave.&rdquo; <a
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Morgann is one who has an
honourable niche in Boswell&rsquo;s inimitable &ldquo;Life of
Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morgann afterwards removed to High Row, where he died March
28th, 1802, in his seventy-seventh year.&nbsp; &ldquo;As a man,
he stood detached from the general contagion of the age he lived
in; neither complying with the vices of the great, however
familiar or seductive, nor with their frivolities, however
general or imposing.&nbsp; His mind was compounded of pure and
simple elements, which inseparably mixed in his business, his
friendships, and intercourse with all mankind; and it was often
no less pleasing to his friends, than to the lovers of virtue in
general, to see with what lustre those plain but prepossessing
colours outshone the glare of <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>fashion, and the accommodating
varnish of modern morals.&rdquo; <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lowndes Square</span>, so named from
William Lowndes, Esq., of Chesham, to whom the land
belongs.&nbsp; According to Dr. King, rector of Chelsea (1694 to
1732), in his MS. account of that parish, <a
name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a> this site at one time belonged to a
Benedictine convent.&nbsp; It certainly formed part of the gift
of Edward the Confessor to the Abbey, but has been in lay hands
ever since the Reformation.&nbsp; At about where William Street
joins the Square stood a large detached house, formerly a place
of amusement, and known as Spring Garden.&nbsp; Dr. King mentions
it as &ldquo;an excellent Spring Garden.&rdquo; <a
name="citation149c"></a><a href="#footnote149c"
class="citation">[149c]</a>&nbsp; And among the entries of
&ldquo;The Virtuosi, or St. Luke&rsquo;s Club,&rdquo; Established
by Vandyke, is the following allusion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Paid and spent at Spring Gardens, by
Knightsbridge, forfeiture &pound;3 15 shgs.&rdquo; <a
name="citation149d"></a><a href="#footnote149d"
class="citation">[149d]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That enjoyable chronicler, Pepys, too, I fancy alludes to
Spring Gardens in the following <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>entry in his
&ldquo;Diary.&rdquo;&nbsp; It must be premised that the hearty
clerk of the Admiralty had been to Kensington, and there, as was
frequently his wont, had had what he innocently and amusingly
terms a &ldquo;frolic&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;June 16, 1664.&nbsp; I lay in my drawers,
and stockings, and waistcoat till five of the clock, and so up,
and being well pleased with our frolic, walked to Knightsbridge,
and there ate a mess of cream, and so to St. James&rsquo;,&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And again he chronicles (April 24th, 1665) a visit to the
Park.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the King being there, and I now-a-days
being doubtful of being seen in any pleasure, did part from the
town, and away out of the Park to Knightsbridge, and there ate
and drank in the coach and so home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spring Gardens was at this time a name applied to almost all
places of outdoor recreation, the appellation being borrowed from
the celebrated garden near Charing Cross.&nbsp; But Pepys speaks
also of a place of entertainment called &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s
End,&rdquo; at Knightsbridge, which I believe could have been
only the sign adopted by the owner of this garden for his
house.&nbsp; Pepys, on another occasion relating that he went
forth to Hyde Park, was &ldquo;<i>too </i><a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span><i>soon to
go in</i>, so went on to Knightsbridge, and there ate and drank
at the World&rsquo;s End, where we had good things, and then back
to the Park, and there till night, being fine weather, and much
company.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; May 9th, 1669.)&nbsp;
Again, on May 31st in the same year, he records going &ldquo;to
the World&rsquo;s End, a drinking-house by the Park, and there
merry, and so home late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Congreve, in his &ldquo;Love for Love,&rdquo; alludes, in a
regular woman&rsquo;s quarrel, to the place:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Pooh, here&rsquo;s a
clutter!&mdash;Why should it reflect upon you?&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t doubt but you have thought yourself happy in a
hackney coach before now.&nbsp; If I had gone to Knightsbridge,
or to Chelsea, or to Spring Garden, or Barn Elms, with a man
alone&mdash;something might have been said.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;Why, was I ever in any of those
places!&nbsp; What do you mean, sister?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Was I? what do you mean?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;You have been at a worse
place.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;I at a worse place, and with a
man!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;I suppose you would not go alone
to the World&rsquo;s End?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;The World&rsquo;s End!&nbsp; What do
you mean to banter me?</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;Poor innocent; you don&rsquo;t
know that there is a place called the World&rsquo;s End.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll swear you can keep your countenance&mdash;surely
you&rsquo;ll make an admirable player.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll swear you have a great
deal of impudence, and, in my mind, too much for the stage.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;No.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;You deny it positively to my

<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Your face! what&rsquo;s your

<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;No matter for that, it is as good
a face as yours.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Not by a dozen years&rsquo;

then.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;I&rsquo;ll allow you now to find
fault with my face; for I&rsquo;ll swear your impudence has put
me out of countenance.&nbsp; But look you here now; where did you
lose this gold bodkin?&mdash;Oh, sister!&mdash;oh, sister!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;My bodkin!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;Nay, it is yours&mdash;look at
it.</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Frail</i>.&mdash;Well, if you go to that, where did
you find this bodkin?&nbsp; Oh sister! sister! sister every
way!</p>
<p><i>Mrs. Foresight</i>.&mdash;Oh! devil on&rsquo;t that I could
not discover her without betraying myself.&nbsp;

<p>The house belonging to this garden stood till about
1826.&nbsp; For many years it was the residence of a Dr. C.
Kelly, who here had an anatomical museum.&nbsp; He resided here
in 1773, and quitted it about 1805.&nbsp; The house was
afterwards tenanted by a gentleman named Bowes; and the museum
became the auction-room of Mr. Herring.&nbsp; About 1818, Warren,
builder to George III., took the premises; he turned the whole
into workshops.&nbsp; After him <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>came Mr. Cubitt, who, about 1828,
procuring a lease from Mr. Lowndes, pulled the whole down, and
laid out the ground for buildings.&nbsp; The first houses were
erected about 1836&ndash;7, but it was not till 1849 that the
square was wholly completed.</p>
<p>Various relics of the Civil War have been found on this site:
arms, spurs, bits, cockades, &amp;c.; and relics telling of a
different kind of struggle&mdash;staves and handcuffs, evidences
of successful rencontres between the footpad and the
constable.&nbsp; A path by the stream&rsquo;s side ran along to
Bloody Bridge, proceeding thence to Ranelagh.&nbsp; On grand gala
nights such paths were protected by patrols and the more able of
the Chelsea Pensioners.</p>
<p>Among the eminent inhabitants of Lowndes Square may be
enumerated the late Sir William Molesworth and Mr. Leader, M.P.
for Westminster, at No. 1; Mr. M. J. Higgins, celebrated for his
contributions on military matters to the <i>Times</i>, also lived
at No. 1.&nbsp; He is thus delineated by Mrs. Gascoigne in her
poem, &ldquo;Belgravia:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nor whilst my muse still haunts these
favourite bounds,<br />
Shall she forget to sing thy Square, O Lowndes!<br />
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Harbour
of peace, near which the troubled sea<br />
Of human traffic roars unceasingly,<br />
Yet enters not&mdash;though day by day it swells<br />
Fiercer and fiercer; at the opening dwells<br />
A man whom rage and clamour ne&rsquo;er withstood,<br />
The well-known champion of the neighbourhood!<br />
Him all who seek oppression view with fear,<br />
For sharp his wit, his mind acute and clear!<br />
With subtlest force, he wields the powerful pen.<br />
But aims it at abuses, not at men!<br />
Him Vestries know, and Rate Collectors dread,<br />
For cool his spirit&mdash;hard his reasoning head;<br />
And though a giant in his strength he be,<br />
Yet free from Tyrant&rsquo;s love of rule is he;<br />
And whilst men seek, and to his judgment bend,<br />
They find in him a leader and a friend.&rdquo; <a

<p>Mrs. Gascoigne, author of &ldquo;Belgravia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Spencer&rsquo;s Cross Manor House,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Next
Door Neighbours,&rdquo; and other works, resides at No. 14.&nbsp;
Admiral Sotheby, one who fought at the Nile, lived at No. 38, and
died January, 20th, 1854.&nbsp; Sir Henry Campbell, who died in
1856, Sir Willoughby Cotton, Mr. Tite, M.P., Mr. Brassey, the
extensive contractor, Mr. Whiteside, M.P., Mr. R. B. Wingfield,
and Mr. Malins, M.P., number also among the inhabitants of
Lowndes Square.</p>
<p>The row of houses on the south side was designed by Mr. Lewis
Cubitt, and with greater <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>regard to architectural effect than
anything of its kind then in the metropolis.&nbsp; It was built
in 1843.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lowndes Terrace</span>&mdash;A row of
shops between William Street and Sloane Street, occupying the
site of a row of old-fashioned houses, of two storeys high, with
pleasant gardens in front and rear, giving the roadway quite a
rural appearance.&nbsp; The house at the eastern end belonged to
one Banting, who built some projecting shops over the front
gardens in 1815, and named the row Waterloo Market.&nbsp; His
expectations were not realised; and in 1823 these old premises
were removed, and the present houses erected.&nbsp; There were
but six houses.&nbsp; At No. 5 resided, fifty years ago, Andrews,
an artist of some repute in his day; and at No. 6 for some years
lived the mother of Rodwell, the author and composer; and her
son&rsquo;s early years were partly passed at this pleasant
spot.</p>
<p>At the west end of this row a narrow lane, called
Porter&rsquo;s Lane, led to the fields.&nbsp; On its right-hand
side, and divided from it by a hedge, stood a large detached
mansion, known as <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>Knightsbridge Grove, approached through a fine avenue
of stately trees from the highway.&nbsp; For many years a man
named Hicks, a &ldquo;sporting character,&rdquo; kept the place,
and George IV., when Prince of Wales, and others of similar
tastes, were led hither.&nbsp; Mr. Egg, the gunmaker, once
erected a large wooden building for some balloon experiments in
the grounds.&nbsp; And this was, I believe, the house where the
notorious Teresa Cornellys attempted to recover her bygone
reputation.</p>
<p>Teresa Cornellys was a native of Germany; and early showing an
inclination to music, was brought up to it as a profession, and
soon became celebrated on the Continent as a public singer.&nbsp;
Having accumulated a considerable sum of money, she came to
England, about 1757; and her fame gradually becoming known, she
was induced, in 1763, to open Carlisle House, Soho Square, as a
place of public entertainment.&nbsp; None but the upper classes
were admitted, and the rooms were decorated in the most costly
manner.&nbsp; Her balls, concerts, and masquerades soon gained
great celebrity, being carried on in a most glaring and
extravagant <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>style.&nbsp; And this was not all: her masquerades were
characterised, not only by indecency, but also by mockery of the
most solemn feelings and principles. <a
name="citation157a"></a><a href="#footnote157a"
class="citation">[157a]</a>&nbsp; The lessees of the theatres
were injured by her popularity, and stimulated the outcry which
began to arise; and at length she was convicted before Sir John
Fielding for performing dramatic entertainments without a
licence.&nbsp; The opposition of the managers, and the Pantheon
opening with a class of amusements somewhat similar in 1772, with
the restraint imposed by the magistrate&rsquo;s decision,
combined to ruin her; and in August, 1772, her effects were sold
by auction, and she became a bankrupt. <a
name="citation157b"></a><a href="#footnote157b"
class="citation">[157b]</a></p>
<p>The allusions to Mrs. Cornellys in contemporary literature are
innumerable; Murphy, in his Epilogue to <i>Zobeide</i>, 1771,
refers to her popularity:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,
farewell!<br />
For her each haunt that charms a modern belle!<br />
Adieu, Almack&rsquo;s!&nbsp; Cornellys&rsquo;! masquerade!<br />
Sweet Ranelagh!&nbsp; Vauxhall&rsquo;s enchanting shade!&rdquo;
&amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>This
allusion will suffice for one view of her career.&nbsp; The
opposite is severely described by Combe, in his satire &ldquo;The
Diabolady,&rdquo; published in 1777:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The ready ministers of hell&rsquo;s
commands,<br />
Obedient fly, and take their several stands<br />
At Court, Cornellys&rsquo;, and the Coterie;<br />
Where vice, more vicious by effrontery,<br />
Fearless, unblushing, braves the eternal laws<br />
Of God and man to aid the devil&rsquo;s cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After her bankruptcy she followed her profession for several
years at various places in London, but in 1785 was obliged to
retire from the importunities of her creditors.&nbsp; Ten years
after, to the great surprise of the public, she reappeared at
Knightsbridge as Mrs. Smith, a retailer of asses&rsquo;
milk.&nbsp; A suite of breakfast-rooms was opened; but her former
influence could not be recovered.&nbsp; The speculation utterly
failed; and at length she was consigned to the Fleet
Prison.&nbsp; There she ended her shallow career, dying August
19, 1797.</p>
<p>Immediately beyond the entrance to the Grove stood Messrs.
Downing&rsquo;s floor-cloth manufactory, formerly Morley and
Downing&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was a pleasant detached house, with a
clean <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>white front, and conspicuous green verandahs.&nbsp; It
was pulled down in 1823, and the manufacturing department removed
to the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Montpelier Square</span>, so called from
the salubrity of its air, <a name="citation159"></a><a
href="#footnote159" class="citation">[159]</a> was built about
1837.&nbsp; Mr. Fairholt, the distinguished artist and antiquary
(at No. 10), Mr. Walter Lacy (38), Dr. Morison (27), and the Rev.
Mackenzie Walcot, to whose writings on the city of Westminster I
owe several obligations, are among its residents.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">New Street</span>, built, I believe, about
1773, was a new street across the fields to Sloane Street, and is
the point dividing Knightsbridge and Brompton&mdash;formerly,
according to the landladies, a very &ldquo;respectable&rdquo;
street; it has in our day sadly changed.&nbsp; At No. 7, Chalon,
the animal painter, resided; and at No. 6, the Right Hon. David
Pigott in 1824 and &rsquo;25, while studying under Mr.,
afterwards Chief Justice, Tindal.&nbsp; Mr. Godwin, the editor of
the <i>Builder</i>, also in his boyhood.&nbsp; In Exeter Street
resided a family named Perrin, one of whom it has been said was
employed by the Duchess of <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Kingston to furnish a place of
meeting between Prince George, afterwards George III., and his
fair <i>inamorata</i>, Hannah Lightfoot. <a
name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160"
class="citation">[160]</a>&nbsp; The Perrins appear to have long
resided in Knightsbridge; entries of the name occur in the
registers of Trinity Chapel as far back as 1680.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Park Side</span>, abutting on the south
side of Hyde Park, is a part of the manor of Knightsbridge,
although eastward of the stream, and is the freehold of the Dean
and Chapter of Westminster.&nbsp; The Birkheads were once the
lessees; at present it is rented by the descendants of Mr.
Gamble, of Trinity Chapel.&nbsp; The row of petty shops at its
east end were erected about fifty years since, the houses
formerly extending no further than the one now occupied by Miss
Marshall.&nbsp; The Knightsbridge Bank, a private concern, was
carried on in Mr. W. Stocken&rsquo;s house, and these shops were
offices belonging thereto.</p>
<p>Just within the park is a conduit, which supplies the palace
with spring water; a descent of three steps in the main road led
to a receptacle for its supply to the inhabitants of
Knightsbridge, <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>which still exists in another form.&nbsp; Close to this
&ldquo;spring,&rdquo; as it is termed, the stocks were placed for
the punishment of village sots and rogues.&nbsp; No hamlet around
the &ldquo;great wen,&rdquo; as Cobbett called the metropolis,
was without one.&nbsp; Taylor, the water-poet, says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In London, and within a mile, I ween,<br />
There are of jails or prisons full eighteen,<br />
And sixty whipping-posts, and stocks, and cages!&rdquo; <a

<p>At No. 10 resided for many years John Read, a man of great
benevolence of character, of scientific celebrity, and of high
repute in the locality.&nbsp; He was born in 1726, and being
brought up as a mathematical instrument-maker, settled in
Knightsbridge about 1754.&nbsp; He became known for his
researches into electricity, <a name="citation161b"></a><a
href="#footnote161b" class="citation">[161b]</a> and published,
in 1793, an octavo volume, entitled &ldquo;A Summary View of the
Spontaneous Electricity of the Earth and Atmosphere,&rdquo; an
accurate and judicious work; but it led him into a controversy
with Dr. Peart, a writer on the same subject.&nbsp; He also
studied meteorology, <a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>and a journal on that subject he
contributed to the &ldquo;Philosophical Transactions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other points of his history are told on the stone to his
memory in St. George&rsquo;s Ground, Bayswater, where he was
buried.&nbsp; The inscription I subjoin:&mdash;</p>

<p>Without Patron, or Patrimony, by the honest fruits of
Industry, he laid the foundation of an easy competence.&nbsp;
More indebted to Prudence than Fortune for his acquisitions; but
to Temperance alone for his length of days.&nbsp; A deep
Researcher of the latent causes of Nature&rsquo;s Phenomena; her
vital Principle, he held in obedience, while he enriched the
science of Electricity with his experiments.&nbsp; Pleased in the
pursuit of Knowledge, and happy in the practice of Virtue; He was
a Philosopher with a benevolent heart, the Father of the
Knightsbridge Charity School; of the Free School of his native
place the Revivor.&nbsp; He lived an Example worthy of imitation,
and died without a groan.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Goding, founder of the well-known brewing firm,

<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>The
Queen&rsquo;s Head, an old inn next the Chapel, was pulled down
in 1843.&nbsp; The house was once very curious inside, but had
been considerably altered.&nbsp; On its removal the date 1576 was
found inscribed in the brickwork.</p>
<p>The White Hart was more curious than the Queen&rsquo;s Head,
and retained its characteristics to the last, when it was removed
for the Albert Gate improvements.&nbsp; Human remains, various
ancient implements, and coins were turned up below its
foundation.&nbsp; A filthy court ran from it along the bank of
the stream.&nbsp; I have seen a memorandum of agreement by which
a house next door to the White Hart was let in 1694 for <i>five
pounds per annum</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Princes Gate</span>.&mdash;Two terraces
are so called, very absurdly. <a name="citation163"></a><a

gate is an entrance to the Park opposite, named after the Prince
of Wales, and opened in October, 1848.&nbsp; It stands on the
highest plot of ground between Hyde Park Corner and Windsor
Castle.</p>
<p>Of the western terrace Mr. Leigh Hunt complains that
&ldquo;each house is too high for its width,&rdquo; and says
&ldquo;they resemble a set of tall <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>thin gentlemen squeezing together to
look at something over the way.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot agree with
Mr. Hunt&rsquo;s humour, and consider them a very handsome and
pleasing row.&nbsp; Mr. Elmes, architect of St. George&rsquo;s
Hall, was designer, I believe, and Mr. Elger the builder; the
eastern row was finished in 1851, the western in 1855.&nbsp; At
No. 23, Vice-Chancellor Parker resided for a short while before
his death.&nbsp; Between the two terraces stands</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Kingston House</span>, built about 1770, a
large and pleasant mansion, and when first erected attracting
notice by the conservatory attached to it.&nbsp; In this
conservatory is a large window, representing a garden scene,

painter.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chudleigh was daughter of a Devonshire gentleman,
who died when she was very young; but her mother having interest
with Mr. Pulteney, she was appointed, at the age of eighteen,
maid of honour to the Princess of Wales, mother to George
III.&nbsp; In the aristocratic circle into which she was now
introduced, she soon became a great favourite, and more than one
young scion of nobility cast <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>a lover&rsquo;s eye towards
her.&nbsp; The young Duke of Hamilton was, however, the
successful one; and the pledge of affiance passed mutually.&nbsp;
He set forth on his travels, and she retired to the residence of
an aunt, Mrs. Hanmer, where she found one of the most frequent
visitors was the Hon. Mr. Hervey.&nbsp; He seems to have made up
his mind instantly; but aware of her pledge to the duke, he
induced Mrs. Hanmer to intercept their letters.&nbsp; The result
of the scheme was as Hervey expected: no letters arriving, Miss
Chudleigh believed herself slighted; and wrought on by the
persuasions of Mrs. Hanmer, agreed to accept Captain
Hervey.&nbsp; They were married privately, August 4th, 1744, but
separated the day after, she continuing to fill her office as
maid of honour.&nbsp; The dissimulation this compelled her to
practise was probably the main cause of her after misfortunes; it
was only by the knowledge that he would be compelled to maintain
her, that Captain Hervey could be induced not to assert his
claim; and her union being unknown at Court, she was still as
much courted as ever.&nbsp; Home came Hamilton&mdash;he had been
faithful to her&mdash;and demanded that explanation she was not
able <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>(unaccountably to him) to give, offered his hand again,
which, of course, she was compelled to refuse.&nbsp; His despair
was excessive; inquiries were made, and the duplicity of Mrs.
Hanmer unveiled.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, instead of allowing time to soothe her sorrows,
she began to drown them in a manner which showed a disregard of
her sex and position.&nbsp; To escape the torrent of torment, she
resolved to travel; but unwilling to go alone, was indiscreet
enough to advertise in the newspapers for a companion.&nbsp; She
succeeded, and off they started; but, as might have been
expected, were soon tired of each other, and separated at
Berlin.&nbsp; Here she was introduced to the great Frederick, who
treated her with great distinction.</p>
<p>Returning home, she plunged into all the dissipation which
then characterised society in the metropolis; but again her
husband crossed her path and seemed determined to claim her, and
finding remonstrance useless, she resorted to the dishonest
stratagem of tearing out the leaf bearing the register of her
marriage.&nbsp; Her husband had now no power to prove their
union, as the clergyman who performed the <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>ceremony
was dead.&nbsp; This step she soon regretted; for Captain Hervey,
succeeding to the Earldom of Bristol, by his father&rsquo;s
death, her vanity made the rank of Countess very acceptable, and
through the clerk she succeeded in replacing in the register-book
the leaf she had abstracted.</p>
<p>Such was her position when the Duke of Kingston offered her
his hand.&nbsp; Of course such was impossible; and accordingly
they lived together for several years, but with such observance
of external decorum, that though a moral, it was not an evidenced
certainty.&nbsp; Her husband, on negotiations being opened,
refused to gratify her with the title of Duchess; but a
separation afterwards suiting his own wishes, he agreed not to
oppose her application for a divorce, and the necessary proofs
being withheld, it was granted.&nbsp; She now attained her
wishes, and was married to the Duke March 8th, 1769.</p>
<p>While the Duke lived, the legality of the marriage was not
questioned; but he died September 24th, 1773, and left her his
whole fortune, on condition she did not marry again&mdash;a
restraint she was by no means inclined to abide by.&nbsp; She,
however, set out for Rome, where <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Ganganelli gave her apartments in
the palace of one of his cardinals, and otherwise showed her
distinction.&nbsp; Here, however, her gaiety was soon stopped by
news of a disagreeable nature from home.</p>
<p>A Mrs. Cradock had been present as a domestic at her marriage
with Lord Bristol, and, being in reduced circumstances, applied
to the Duchess&rsquo;s solicitor for relief; he, discrediting her
tale, refused any, on which she went to Mr. Evelyn Pierrepoint,
nephew of the Duke, and informed him of every particular.&nbsp;
He thereupon preferred an indictment for bigamy against the
Duchess, of which being informed, she, after surmounting various
obstacles, landed at Dover, and was immediately bailed before
Lord Mansfield, preparatory to taking her trial.</p>
<p>Before, however, that came on, an unexpected enemy
appeared.&nbsp; Foote, imagining the case to afford capital
material for his wit, wrote a piece, called &ldquo;The Trip to
Calais,&rdquo; in which the Duchess was cleverly satirised as
<i>Lady Kitty Crocodile</i>.&nbsp; Foote, whose real object was
to obtain a sum of money to suppress the piece, contrived to let
her know what was astir; and <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>the Duchess, alarmed for once most
terribly, sent for him.&nbsp; He waited on, and read her a part
of his play.&nbsp; She felt the sting, and rose in great passion,
declaring his delineation scandalous.&nbsp; He denied that the
character was intended for her ladyship, and the play was left
for her perusal.&nbsp; An intimation was made as Foote expected;
but he refusing the offer of &pound;1,600, and declaring he would
not abate one shilling from the &pound;2,000 demanded, he lost
all; for her friends interceding with the Lord Chamberlain, he
sent for, and censured the play.&nbsp; Foote published a letter
of remonstrance, but the Duchess making every preparation for an
action at law, he was completely defeated.&nbsp; A paper-war
ensued, in which Foote had the advantage, greatly to the
amusement, if not edification, of the public.</p>
<p>On April 15th, 1776, her trial commenced in Westminster Hall,
Lord Bathurst sitting as Lord Steward.&nbsp; She was convicted;
but pleading the privilege of the peerage, was discharged with a
caution.</p>
<p>She left England immediately, and passed the rest of her life
abroad.&nbsp; She purchased a <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>magnificent estate near
Fontainebleau, where she died, August 20th, 1788. <a
name="citation170a"></a><a href="#footnote170a"
class="citation">[170a]</a></p>
<p>After the death of the Duchess of Kingston, her mansion at
Knightsbridge became the residence, successively, of Sir George
Warren, Lord Stair, Lord Listowel, and the Marquis of Wellesley,
brother of the great Duke of Wellington, and himself one of the
foremost statesmen of the time.&nbsp; He resided at Kingston
House some years, living in great retirement, and died in it
September 26th, 1842, in his 83rd year. <a
name="citation170b"></a><a href="#footnote170b"
class="citation">[170b]</a></p>
<p>Kingston House was, after Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s death, again
the residence of the Earl of Listowel, to whom the freehold
belonged; and it is at present inhabited by his son, the present
earl. <a name="citation170c"></a><a href="#footnote170c"

<p><span class="smcap">Queen&rsquo;s Buildings</span>, commenced
about 1770, <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>and was named after Queen Charlotte.&nbsp; That part of
it between Sloane Street and Hooper&rsquo;s Court was originally
called Queen&rsquo;s Row, the remainder Queen&rsquo;s Buildings,
Knightsbridge, and at one time Gloucester Buildings.</p>
<p>First, I will notice Queen&rsquo;s Row.&nbsp; Here, in 1772,
the celebrated engraver, William Wynne Ryland, resided.&nbsp;
Ryland was born in 1732, and, inclining towards the profession of
an engraver, became a pupil of Simon Revenet, then established in
this country.&nbsp; On quitting him, his godfather, Sir Watkin
Williams Wynne, sent him to Paris, where he studied under Francis
Boucher, and J. P. Le Bas.&nbsp; After four years sojourn he
returned to England, and was appointed engraver to the
King.&nbsp; He was the first person who introduced into this
country the style of engraving in the chalk manner, applying
himself chiefly to the pictures of Angelica Kauffman.&nbsp; This
system he greatly improved, and in it had no equal.</p>
<p>Strutt laments that his &ldquo;mercantile engagements should
have occupied so valuable a part of his precious time, and
prevented his pursuing the art with that alacrity his genius
required, which seemed formed for great and extensive <a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>exertions.&rdquo;&nbsp; He commenced business
originally in Cornhill, but here became bankrupt.&nbsp; He
afterwards came to Knightsbridge, where he resided till the
dreadful act was discovered which consigned him to the
gallows.</p>
<p>On July 26th, 1783, he was tried before Judge Buller, for
forging a bill of exchange for &pound;200.&nbsp; He well-nigh
escaped; the forgery being so beautifully executed that it was
only the evidence of the paper-maker which convicted him.&nbsp;
Great exertions were made to save him, but fruitlessly; and he
was executed at Tyburn, August 29th, 1783.&nbsp; A few months
after, the stream being cleared of some of its mud, in order to
widen the roadway within the Park, a tin box containing some of
the unfortunate man&rsquo;s plates for counterfeiting banknotes,
was discovered. <a name="citation172"></a><a href="#footnote172"
class="citation">[172]</a></p>
<p>No. 14 (corner of Hooper&rsquo;s Court) was from 1792 to 1797
the residence of Mr. J. C. Nattes, an artist of celebrity in his
time.&nbsp; About the year 1800 this house became the residence
of the celebrated Arthur Murphy.</p>
<p>Arthur Murphy was born at Cork in 1727.&nbsp; Early in life he
was sent to St. Omer&rsquo;s, where <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>he studied till his eighteenth year,
when he returned to Cork, and passed two years as clerk in a
merchant&rsquo;s counting-house.&nbsp; At the end of this time he
came to London, and entered a banking-house in a similar
capacity.&nbsp; But literature captivated him, the drama
especially, and it soon absorbed his mind.</p>

</a></p>
<p>His first publication, the &ldquo;Gray&rsquo;s Inn
Journal,&rdquo; commenced October 21st, 1752, and continued for
nearly two years.&nbsp; But his prospects changing by an
uncle&rsquo;s death, he, in October, 1754, betook himself to the
stage, appearing at Covent Garden, and performing <i>Othello</i>,
<i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; But it was apparent
an actor&rsquo;s life he could not follow; Churchill severely
lashed him in the &ldquo;Rosciad,&rdquo; and Murphy retaliated in
an ode, an effusion as coarse as his opponent&rsquo;s attack.</p>
<p>To literature he now mainly turned his attention.&nbsp; In
1756 he produced &ldquo;The Apprentice,&rdquo; a farce, for
Garrick; in 1758 &ldquo;The Upholsterer,&rdquo; and in the
ensuing two years &ldquo;The Orphan of China,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Desert Island,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Way to Keep Him;&rdquo; and
in 1761 he published &ldquo;All in the Wrong,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Citizen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Old Maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>In
the year 1757 he applied for admission to the Middle Temple, but,
on the ground of being an actor, was refused; he, however,
induced Lord Mansfield to interfere on his behalf, and through
this influence he entered Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; He was
called to the Bar in 1762, and eventually became leader of the
Norfolk Circuit.&nbsp; Lord Loughborough also gave him a
Commissionership of Bankrupts&mdash;an office he held till his
death.</p>
<p>The study of &ldquo;Coke upon Littleton&rdquo; was not,
however, sufficiently attractive to wean him from his literary
pursuits, and several plays, all of which were highly popular,
appeared in rapid succession.&nbsp; Among these were his
celebrated &ldquo;Grecian Daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;Know your
own Mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; This latter piece, published in 1777, was
written for Mr. Harris, and was the last he brought on the
stage.</p>
<p>Besides these he also published an edition of Fielding&rsquo;s
works, with a preliminary essay on his life and writings, an
&ldquo;Essay on the Life and Genius of Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; a
translation of Tacitus, and various others.</p>
<p>In 1788 he retired to Hammersmith, where he resided till 1800;
he then came to Knightsbridge, and here, with the exception of a
short <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>time in Brompton Row, he resided till his death.&nbsp;
In this house his &ldquo;Life of Garrick&rdquo; was written; he
appears to have been happy and comfortable in it, occupying the
first and second floors, and having a neat and intelligent
landlady, whose interest he secured by procuring her son a
presentation to Christ&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; He died June 18th,
1805, frequently repeating during the day the couplet of
Pope&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Taught half by reason, half by mere
decay,<br />
To welcome Death, and calmly pass away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was to Murphy, Johnson owed his introduction to Mr.
Thrale.&nbsp; &ldquo;I question,&rdquo; says Madame
D&rsquo;Arblay, &ldquo;if Mr. Thrale loved any man so
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; With Reynolds and Burke, too, he was intimate,
and reviewed the latter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Essay on the Sublime and
Beautiful.&rdquo;&nbsp; At Knightsbridge he became intimate with
Maurice Morgann; but from the singular construction put by the
latter on the characters of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays, silence on
these points was bespoke in their interviews.&nbsp; Morgann died
before Murphy, who deeply regretted, Mr. Foote tells us, his
friend&rsquo;s death. <a name="citation175"></a><a
href="#footnote175" class="citation">[175]</a></p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>At
the corner of Sloane Street, and occupying the site of the first
four houses in it, was the Swan, an ancient and well-known
hostelrie&mdash;a place of great trade in former times.&nbsp; The
sign still exists at No. 5, Sloane Street; and that of the
&ldquo;Clock House&rdquo; is also the same.&nbsp; Indeed the
latter was only the &ldquo;tap&rdquo; to the former, and the
separation of interests has not occurred above forty years.&nbsp;
The old house was pulled down about 1777 or 1778.&nbsp; Otway, in
&ldquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s Fortune,&rdquo; alludes to
it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Sir Davy Dunce</i>.&mdash;&ldquo;I have surely
lost, and ne&rsquo;er shall find her more.&nbsp; She promised me
strictly to stay at home till I came back again; for aught I
know, she may be up three pair of stairs in the Temple now; or it
may be, taking the air, as far as Knightsbridge, with some
smooth-faced rogue or another; &rsquo;tis a damned house that
Swan,&mdash;that Swan at Knightsbridge is a confounded
house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tom Brown also celebrates the Swan; and Dr. Wolcot (Peter
Pindar) lays the scene of one of his coarse effusions
there:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At Knightsbridge, at a tavern called the
Swan,<br />
Churchwardens, overseers, a jolly clan,<br />
Ordered a dinner for themselves&mdash;<br />
A very handsome dinner of the best, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond Hooper&rsquo;s Court (so called from its owner) Mr. J.
G. Huck, an artist, lived at No. 11; Ozias Humphry in 1792 and
1793 at <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>No. 19 (Mitchell&rsquo;s).&nbsp; At 21, Thomas Trotter,
an ingenious engraver and draughtsman, especially in
portraits.&nbsp; He died February 14th, 1803, and was buried in
the Broadway ground, Westminster.</p>
<p>At No. 7 resided Michael Underwood, M.D., one of the most
distinguished members of the medical profession then
living.&nbsp; He wrote several professional works, which,
notwithstanding the advance of the science, yet maintain their
reputation.&nbsp; He attended Caroline of Brunswick at the birth
of the Princess Charlotte.&nbsp; Was a very benevolent man and
the gratuitous adviser to the poor of the whole
neighbourhood.&nbsp; He died here March 14th, 1820.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rutland House</span>, a large red-brick
mansion, occupied the site of the present Rutland Gate.&nbsp;
John, Duke of Rutland, who bore the sceptre at the coronation of
George III., and once filled the office of Lord Lieutenant of
Ireland, died here May 29th, 1779, aged 88.&nbsp; The celebrated
Marquis of Granby, his son, also resided here. <a

Manners, Esq., now, a descendant of the Viceroy.</p>
<p>Rutland Gate was commenced in 1838, and completed as far as
Clytha House in 1840.&nbsp; The remainder has been built since,
the whole being completed in 1856.</p>
<p>The large detached house on the western side (24) was built by
John Sheepshanks, Esq., the distinguished patron of British Art,

of the early Italian schools, which was sold May 8th, 1852.</p>

western end of Rutland Gate, built in the roadway, stood an old
inn, of very bad character at one time, called the &ldquo;Halfway

pig-styes, &amp;c., in a very unsightly manner, were built along
the causeway; and over the door were several proofs of the faith
in the old superstition that horse-shoes were a preventive to the
visits of evil spirits.&nbsp; In one sense the charm was not
efficacious, the house, from its lonely situation, being a resort
for the highwayman and footpad.&nbsp; A curious notice of a trial

<p><span class="smcap">St. George&rsquo;s
Hospital</span>.&mdash;A number of gentlemen of the medical
profession, dissenting from the system of management carried on
at Westminster Hospital, broke off their connection with it, and
engaged Lanesborough House for a new institution, conducted under
their own auspices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Lanesborough House is described by Pennant as the <i>country
house</i> of the eccentric nobleman immortalised by
Pope:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Old politicians chew on wisdom past,<br />
And totter on in business to the last,<br />
As weak, as earnest, and as gravely out,<br />
As sober Lanesbro&rsquo; dancing with the gout.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He caused the following quaint distich to be <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>inscribed
on the house front in reference to its situation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is my delight to be<br />
Both in town and country.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The allusion of Pope to the dancing propensities of this
nobleman is curiously borne out by the fact, that when Prince
George of Denmark died he sought an interview with the widowed
Queen, and advised her to dispel her grief by following his
favourite amusement.&nbsp; Not till disabled entirely by the gout
did he give up this relaxation.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Golden
Gallery&rdquo; around the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s was gilded at
his expense.</p>
<p>Lanesborough House was of red brick, three storeys high, with
one small doorway, approached by three or four steps to the
centre; the new authorities added two wings, also of red brick,
and on January 1st, 1734, the institution was opened, having been
established on October 19th, 1733.</p>
<p>One of those who took a leading part in this foundation was
John Allen, apothecary to the household of George I., George II.,
and George III. successively.&nbsp; He remained a governor till
his death, on March 17th, 1774.&nbsp; <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>Another staunch supporter was the
celebrated anatomist, Cheselden, the friend of Pope and other
literary men.&nbsp; Some of his greatest operations were
performed here.&nbsp; He was also surgeon to Chelsea Hospital,
and in its graveyard lies buried.</p>
<p>The hospital gradually increased in wealth and usefulness,
till in 1784 the governors issued advertisements asking for
increased aid to prevent its decay.&nbsp; This arose from the
fact that a large legacy left by a Mrs. Crayle caused an idea to
be spread abroad that further aid of this kind was hardly
wanted.&nbsp; Its legacies had been a main source of income; they
now fell off, and the Crayle bequest being reversionary, the
income rapidly fell, and at Christmas, 1783, the institution was
above &pound;1,900 in debt; but a third of the profits of the
Handel Festival held in Westminster Abbey in 1784 enabled the
governors to overcome their difficulties.</p>
<p>The celebrated John Hunter was one of the eminent men who have
been connected with St. George&rsquo;s Hospital.&nbsp; He was
appointed surgeon in 1768, and always took an active part in its
management.&nbsp; Here on October 16th, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>1793, his
life was suddenly terminated.&nbsp; He had long disputed a matter
of right with his colleagues, and in an altercation he was flatly
contradicted, when a trifling address might have turned aside the
quarrel.&nbsp; He rushed into an adjoining room and there fell
into the arms of Dr. Robertson, one of the physicians, and his
life was gone in an instant.</p>
<p>The increasing prosperity and demand on the Hospital proved at
last that the old building did not afford the necessary
accommodation, and accordingly its destruction was resolved
on.&nbsp; This was effected in 1827, and the present building
erected from designs by Wilkins.&nbsp; The old front was towards
Hyde Park; the new one faces the Green Park, and is rendered
imposing by its bold and massive tetrastyle portico, supported by
square columns.&nbsp; Besides its numerous wards, here are a
chapel, museum, lecture-room, and private apartments.&nbsp; The
museum, so valuable to the surgeon, is not adapted for the
public, unless to point a moral to the vicious and unwary.&nbsp;
The mere curiosities are interesting; among them is the
half-sovereign taken from Mr. Brunel&rsquo;s windpipe, by Sir
Benjamin Brodie, presented by its proprietor; <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>the hide of
the cow from which Jenner took the first vaccine matter; a packet
of needles, which came simultaneously from the frame of a young
lady, money and knives from patients&rsquo; stomachs, and other
similar relics.</p>
<p>One regular fund is yet wanting to render the institution
complete.&nbsp; Many a fellow-creature, who is entirely
destitute, enters here, and, when recovered, re-enters the world,
without a roof to shelter his weakened frame, or the wherewithal
to obtain the common necessaries of life.&nbsp; Of late this has
been to a certain extent remedied.&nbsp; A porcelain slab has
been let into the wall (a corner-stone of faith it has been
called) bearing the simple inscription&mdash;&ldquo;In aid of
those patients who leave this Hospital homeless and in
need.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ought such an appeal to rest solely on the
charity of the busy multitudes passing by?&nbsp; To announce such
a fund would, I believe, ensure its success.</p>
<p>In the burial-ground of St. George&rsquo;s parish at
Bayswater, is a headstone inscribed&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Sacred to the
Memory of the Rev. James Clarke,<br />
who died June 9th, 1811, aged 85 years.<br />
During fifty-one of which he discharged the duties of Chaplain<br
/>

benefit to<br />
the Institution.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>St.

Landon&rsquo;s poems.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. George&rsquo;s Place</span>, till of
late years, consisted of old-fashioned houses, about two storeys
high.&nbsp; About 1827 the first improvement was made by the
opening of Wilton Place, and gradually these old houses have been
pulled down to make room for superior ones.&nbsp; Towards the
upper end, these houses were detached.&nbsp; In one of them lived
a Captain Warner, one of the heroes of Quebec.&nbsp; About 1829,
Liston lived at No. 7, and at No. 12 for many years resided Mr.
Richards, a well-known London auctioneer, who died here in
1810.</p>
<p>At No. 14 resided for many years the mother of Mr. Justice
Burton, to whom belonged the freehold of this strip of
land.&nbsp; She died here in 1799.&nbsp; Her son, Mr. Justice
Burton, resided for many years in the house at the west corner of
the entrance to the Barrack.&nbsp; Bred to the law, he became
Recorder of Oxford and a King&rsquo;s Counsel, and in July, 1778,
was appointed one of the judges of Wales and Chester.&nbsp; He
represented Woodstock and Oxford in several Parliaments,
supporting the ministry of William Pitt, and at last became <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Father of
the Benchers of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn.&nbsp; He died in Brook
Street, December, 1832, aged 89.&nbsp; The freehold mentioned was
originally vested in the Laremar family.&nbsp; The first one of
whom anything is known, was one William Laremar, captain of the
Loyal Rebecca, a ship trading to Virginia in 1676, a time when
the colony was disturbed by the rebellion of Nathaniel Bacon; the
use of the vessel was given to the governor, Sir William
Berkeley, by whom Laremar was appointed Commodore in St. James
River, and was &ldquo;maynly instrumental in the suppression of
that rebellion and mutiny,&rdquo; for which good service he
received compensation from the Admiralty, the secretary of which
was then Samuel Pepys.&nbsp; From the Laremars the property
passed to the Burtons, from them to the Coles, and it is now
enjoyed by Owen Blayney Cole, Esq.&nbsp; Liston also resided at
14 many years; and the next house was once tenanted by the
Tathams, one of whom married Adam Adolphus, brother of the
celebrated counsellor.</p>
<p>In No. 3 of the present houses lived General Campbell, an old
Peninsular veteran.&nbsp; He died in June, 1852.&nbsp; No. 10 is
the residence of Mr. <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Coningham, M.P. for Brighton, and
11, of James Goding, Esq.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;White Horse Inn&rdquo; was formerly established on
the site of No. 11.; afterwards it was removed to the corner of
the entrance of the Foot Barracks, but was pulled down in
September, 1856, with three houses, one of which was
Liston&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Nos. 15 to 20 were built in
1849&ndash;50.</p>
<p>From the corner of Wilton Place the row extends ten houses
further.&nbsp; No. 28 was Mr. Blore&rsquo;s, the
statuary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A house which stood at the corner, and
narrowed the entrance to Wilton Place very considerably, was
removed about 1841.&nbsp; For many years a Mrs. Dowell carried on
the business of tobacconist here.&nbsp; She was an eccentric old
damsel, and so exceedingly partial to the late Duke of
Wellington, that she was continually inventing some new plan
whereby to express her regard.&nbsp; She sent him occasionally
patties, cakes, and other similar <i>delicacies</i>, and as it
was useless to attempt to defeat the old woman&rsquo;s
pertinacity, everything was taken in.&nbsp; To such a pitch did
she carry this mania, that I have heard she regularly laid for
him at her table, constantly expecting <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>he would
call in.&nbsp; With her lodged William Pickett, who lived in
Knightsbridge the greater part of his life.&nbsp; A gravestone in
St. George&rsquo;s ground tells his short history:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Sacred to the
memory of Mr. William Pickett, artist,<br />
who died at Knightsbridge, on the 23rd day of May, 1821,<br />
aged 45 years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I must not leave St. George&rsquo;s Place without a notice of
John Liston.&nbsp; He was born in 1776; and his father, who lived
in Norris Street, giving him a superior education, he, in 1795,
became second master at Archbishop Tennison&rsquo;s school near
Leicester Square; but thus early the stage appears to have
fascinated him, for he quitted his situation for acting plays
with the elder boys.&nbsp; He then went into a mercantile house
in the City.</p>
<p>When Liston first appeared on the stage is not accurately
known; but the following note from a celebrated manager of the
time appears to prove that to him, at least, he was well
known.&nbsp; It is as follows,&mdash;<i>verbatim</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your not favoring Me with an answ<sup>r</sup> Relative
to the I-dea of the Cast, I at Random (tho&rsquo; very ill)
Scratch&rsquo;t Out, <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>Makes it Necessary for Me to have
Your Opinion, in Order to Prevent Aney Mistake.&nbsp; I am,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Sir,<br />
&ldquo;With every Good Wish,<br />
&ldquo;Yours, &amp;c.,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Tate Wilkinson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He now followed the stage as a profession, and obtained
engagements at various provincial establishments; among others,
at Newcastle-on-Tyne, under Stephen Kemble.&nbsp; The first comic
part he performed was the very subordinate one of <i>Diggory</i>,
and even in this little part contrived to throw that irresistible
originality of humour for which he afterwards became so
celebrated.&nbsp; I have seen the copy the actor learnt from,
with his erasures, interlineations, &amp;c.</p>
<p>His first acknowledged appearance on a London stage was at the
Haymarket, on June 10th, 1805, as <i>Sheepface</i>, in &ldquo;The
Village Lawyer.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the same evening Miss Tyrer made
her re-appearance after a lapse of three years.&nbsp; She was
soon after to become his wife, and they were married on Sunday,
March 22nd, 1807, at St. Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields.&nbsp;
Their mutual friend, Charles Taylor, the celebrated
<i>Noodle</i>, in &ldquo;Tom Thumb,&rdquo; gave the wedding <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>breakfast.&nbsp; The union proved a happy one; one son
and daughter were its issue.&nbsp; The former entered the army;
the latter married Rodwell, the composer.</p>
<p>It is impossible, in this sketch of Liston&rsquo;s life, to
notice all his various performances and successes.&nbsp; His
leading triumphs can alone be glanced at.&nbsp; In January, 1823,
he commenced a &pound;50 per week engagement at Drury Lane, as
<i>Tony Lumpkin</i>; and in May, 1824, George IV. commanded the
&ldquo;Hypocrite,&rdquo; and heartily encored
<i>Mawworm&rsquo;s</i> mock sermon.&nbsp; It was a favourite part
of Liston&rsquo;s, and his performance of it inimitable.&nbsp; I
have seen a letter from a distinguished living actor, who had
played the part, he says, &ldquo;greatly against the grain, well
recollecting Mr. Liston&rsquo;s unapproachable excellence in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the ensuing year he reached the pinnacle of his fame by his
impersonation of <i>Paul Pry</i>.&nbsp; The popularity of the
piece was immense, and chiefly through the unequalled ease and
skill with which he acted his part.&nbsp; His well-known
countenance was to be met with in every conceivable form, in
plaster and clay, in china and butter, in the centre of pocket
handkerchiefs, <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>tobacconists&rsquo; &ldquo;screw&rdquo; papers, and in
a variety of other ways, his unbounded success with the public
was attested.</p>
<p>In 1831 he joined Madame Vestris, and performed with
increasing popularity until the end of the season 1837.&nbsp; He
never took a farewell formally of the stage; and the last time he
ever performed was for the benefit of James Vining, in
Planch&eacute;&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peculiar Position;&rdquo; and as
<i>Monsieur Champignon</i> he ended his professional
career.&nbsp; It was, I believe, known to his friends that this
would be his last appearance, and the following address was
written by Rodwell on this occasion.&nbsp; It has never, I
believe, been published:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Liston, farewell! for once the Comic
Muse<br />
Looks vex&rsquo;d and dismal, griev&rsquo;d with thee to part;<br
/>
And heaves true sighs from her reluctant heart,<br />
While virgin tears her clouded eyes suffuse,<br />
By sorrows forc&rsquo;d, despite of struggling art.<br />
Her mask avails not now.&nbsp; Her faltering voice<br />
Betrays the o&rsquo;er-mastering passion in her soul;<br />
For she must lose the servant of her choice,<br />
Who made her chariot merrily to roll,<br />
When he the Coachman played; and not less great<br />
As the mock Marquis help&rsquo;d her mimic state<br />
Absurdly grave; or at his tricks again<br />
As gay-hair&rsquo;d Figaro swell&rsquo;d her menial train,<br />
Pompous and plausible, serene and sly,<br />
With witty impudence, and humour dry.<br />
<a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Expert
at all trades, too, with <i>last</i> or <i>block</i><br />
Alike to <i>comb</i> or <i>cobble</i> wig or sock;<br />
This he exactly fitted to her toe,<br />
In walk, or jig, or gallopade to go;<br />
And that so quaintly, whimsically curl&rsquo;d,<br />
It grew the merry wonder of the world.<br />
Ney, just to keep the top or sole together,<br />
He&rsquo;d patch the Sock ev&rsquo;n with the Buskin&rsquo;s
leather,<br />
That she might follow in her sister&rsquo;s path<br />
With pewter poison-pot, and dirk of lath;<br />
While he stalk&rsquo;d on in Dollabella&rsquo;s train,<br />
A lord, of whom the Court might well be vain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our tears, O Liston! must with hers be blended<br />
To see, too soon, thy comic labours ended.<br />
And haply, oft when other servants bear<br />
Some mawkish viand of our bill of fare,<br />
Oft shall we turn dissatisfied, and wish<br />
For Liston&rsquo;s sauce, to help th&rsquo; insipid dish;<br />
Whose very look and air were quite enough<br />
To win our favour for the cook&rsquo;s worst stuff.<br />
Or, if the dish be good, provoked to see<br />
Some clumsy serving-man instead of thee.<br />
How shall we think, regretful of thy merit,<br />
Who served up all with such bewitching spirit,<br />
As made the best seem better, and the cook<br />
To thee beholden, more than to his book,<br />
However puff&rsquo;d by papers, or by rumour:&mdash;<br />
Thou great Original in comic humour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>31st May, 1837.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor was this the only tribute Liston received; numerous were
the attempts made to induce him to alter his decision, but he was
inflexible, and it remained irrevocable.&nbsp; One of several
letters I have seen I include here, notwithstanding <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>its writer
is living; but he cannot regret to see a letter given to the
world showing such ability and excellent feeling.&nbsp; It is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">T. R. C. G., Dec. 18,
1839.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Liston</span>,&mdash;My mother
has told me of one or two half-laughing conversations she has had
with you, on the subject of your delighting the public with a few
performances.&nbsp; Jest sometimes leads to earnest, and, on the
principle of never throwing away a good chance, I venture to send
you this to say, that should such a joyful occurrence be within
the verge of possibility at any time, you may consider yourself
King of Covent Garden; act when you please, what you please, and
as long as you please; stop when you please, take what money you
please, and be sure that, do whatever you please, you cannot fail
to please.&nbsp; More than this I cannot say, except that you
shall be allowed to sweeten your own tea, and, when you are too
late for rehearsal, beat the prompter.&nbsp; In plain English,
and in sober earnest, if you will make up your mind to gratify us
by playing a few of your old parts, everything that mortals can
do to make you comfortable <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>and happy shall be done, and we
shall be most proud in being the caterers of a national
treat.</p>
<p>I will not bore you more&mdash;only say the word, and we are
&ldquo;at your feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ever yours, with kind regards to Mrs. Liston, very truly and
very faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">C. J. <span
class="smcap">Mathews</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Liston wrote a copy of his answer on the fly-leaf of this
letter as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr.
Mathews</span>,&mdash;Notwithstanding the skill you exhibit in
endeavouring to arouse my dormant vanity, be assured, once for
all, it cannot prevail to overcome the unalterable determination
I came to when I quitted the stage, never to reappear
professionally before the public.&nbsp; Not only should I
consider my reassuming the cap and bells, at my advanced age, a
moral indecorum; my decaying strength also would render the
experiment too hazardous, and I have no doubt were Mr. Wakley the
coroner to have to preside at an inquest on my remains, he
would&mdash;as he did the other day, in the case of a poor old
woman who drank herself to death&mdash;suggest to the jury the
propriety of returning a verdict of <i>Felo-de-se</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Accept, however, my very grateful thanks for your
liberal proposal, as well as for the terms in which the offer has
been conveyed; they bring back a pleasing remembrance of the
position we stood in to each other a few years back, to which,
though for a time interrupted, I trust we are once again happily
restored.</p>
<p>Mrs. Liston joins me in sincere hopes for the continual
prosperity of you and yours, and believe me (once again my
<i>dear</i> Charles),</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your friend and well wisher,<br />
J. <span class="smcap">Liston</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This correspondence, so interesting and so creditable to both
parties, shows Liston to have had a kind heart and joyous
disposition, and that such can exist with the highest notions of
moral responsibility.&nbsp; Liston&rsquo;s private life was
retired and becoming, the love of literature, acquired early,
never left him; few persons were greater students than he, and
his knowledge of the Scriptures is said to have been very
extensive.</p>
<p>The illness which terminated his life first attacked him four
years previously, in the form of apoplexy.&nbsp; The last attack
came on suddenly, on March 16th, 1846, and he never <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>spoke
again.&nbsp; He lingered till the ensuing Sunday, when he died in
the arms of his wife.&nbsp; That same day, and almost that same
hour (half-past ten), thirty-nine years previously, and <i>on a
Sunday too</i>, she had sworn &ldquo;to love and to cherish till
death should them part,&rdquo; and thus literally she fulfilled
her vow.</p>
<p>He lies at Kensal Green; over his grave rises a column,
bearing the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sacred to the Memory of John Liston, who
died March 22nd, 1846, aged 73.&nbsp; He lived many years an
ornament to his profession, and died much respected and
regretted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Liston survived her husband eight years.&nbsp; Born about
1780, she became a pupil of Kelly, and made her first London
appearance in 1800.&nbsp; She was always a favourite with the
public, the very appropriate part of <i>Queen Dolabella</i>, in
&ldquo;Tom Thumb,&rdquo; being generally considered her
best.&nbsp; She died at No. 28, Brompton Square, whither she
removed from Knightsbridge, September 19th, 1854.</p>
<p>Behind St. George&rsquo;s Place was formerly a foot-barrack,
established about 1758.&nbsp; It continued to be used as a depot
until 1835 or 1836, when Government sold the remainder of their
<a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>lease.&nbsp; On part of the drill ground St.
Paul&rsquo;s Church is built, and the barracks are let out as
tenements.&nbsp; Over a portion of its parade-ground Mr. Dunn
built the St. George&rsquo;s Gallery, for his &ldquo;Chinese
Collection;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Exhibition of Modern Art&rdquo; was
also, with other attractions, located here; among them Mr. Gordon
Cumming, with the relics of his African exploits.&nbsp; The lease
of this property is just expiring, and various improvements are
contemplated.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tattersall&rsquo;s</span>.&mdash;Richard
Tattersall, founder of this well-known establishment, was born in
1723.&nbsp; He became training-groom to the last Duke of
Kingston, after whose death, I presume, he started on his own
account at Hyde Park Corner, as I find he sold off the
Duke&rsquo;s stud, and an injunction was applied for, December
14th, 1774, to prevent payment of the money to the Duchess, then
under indictment.&nbsp; In 1775 frequent advertisements of
Tattersall&rsquo;s show that his business rapidly progressed, and
his establishment soon became the head-quarters of the sporting
world.&nbsp; That it early gained an aristocratic fame is proved
by <a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>the
allusion in &ldquo;The Belle&rsquo;s Stratagem,&rdquo; first
performed in 1782:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Flutter</i>: Oh, yes! I stopped at
Tattersall&rsquo;s as I came by, and there I found Lord James
Jessamy, Sir William Wilding, and Mr. &mdash;.&nbsp; But, now I
think of it, you sha&rsquo;nt know a syllable of the matter; for
I have been informed you never believe above one-half of what I
say.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Richard Tattersall died February 20th, 1795, aged 72.&nbsp;
Two portraits of him are still in his descendants&rsquo;
possession; from one of them a portrait in &ldquo;Knight&rsquo;s
London&rdquo; is engraved. <a name="citation198"></a><a
href="#footnote198" class="citation">[198]</a>&nbsp; He was
succeeded in his business by his only son, Edmund, who carried it
on until his death, January 23rd, 1810.&nbsp; His son, Edmund,
who founded the foreign trade, then succeeded; who dying December
11th, 1851, the business came to its present proprietors.</p>
<p>The entrance to Tattersall&rsquo;s is from Grosvenor Place,
down a deep descent under an unpretending archway.&nbsp; At the
bottom is a tavern, bearing the appropriate sign of &ldquo;The
Turf,&rdquo; opposite to which is a gateway, leading into a
circular-shaped inclosure, on the skirt of which <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>is a gravel
path encircling a grass-plot, from the centre of which rises a
solitary tree; here the horses are tried and examined.&nbsp; The
subscription room&mdash;a well proportioned one&mdash;was
designed by Mr. George Tattersall, author of &ldquo;Sporting
Architecture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Over the mantelpiece of the
counting-house hang the regulations, dated 1780.&nbsp; In the
courtyard is a domed structure surmounted by a bust of George IV.
in his eighteenth year, at which period of life he was a frequent
visitor.&nbsp; Beneath this dome is a pump, surmounted by the
figure of a fox.&nbsp; A writer in the &ldquo;Sporting
Magazine&rdquo; (June, 1852) stated that
&ldquo;Tattersall&rsquo;s annual average of horses brought to the
hammer, is estimated at &pound;45,000,&rdquo; and that he
believed &ldquo;there were 97 stalls, and 13 loose boxes, or
standing for 110.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chief business days are
Mondays and Thursdays.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Trevor Square</span>, so named from Sir
John Trevor, who had a house on its site, was built about
1818.&nbsp; The freehold is still that of his descendant, Lord
Duncannon; hence the names to be met with here are derived, such
as Hill Street, Arthur Street, Duncannon Cottage, &amp;c.</p>
<p>At No. 1 in the square lived the notorious <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Harriette
Wilson; and Mrs. Andr&eacute;e, a descendant of the Umfreville,
whom William the Conqueror styled his kinsman, died here in
1836.</p>
<p>Trevor Chapel, one of the largest places of worship in the
metropolis, belonging to the Independents, was built about 1817,
under the ministry of the Rev. John Morrison, D.D.&nbsp; He is
still its nominal minister, but his great age and infirmities
preclude any active duty.&nbsp; The officiating pastor is the
Rev. John Statham.&nbsp; Dr. Morrison is beloved not only by his
congregation, but by the whole community of London
Dissenters.&nbsp; He is known also as the author of several
theological works, the best of which is a &ldquo;Commentary on
the Psalms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the last century a portion of the land about this part was
rented by a French Protestant refugee family, named Moreau, of
which General Moreau was a member.&nbsp; They returned to France
about eighty years since. <a name="citation200"></a><a
href="#footnote200" class="citation">[200]</a></p>
<p>All this land one hundred and fifty years ago was the property
of Sir John Trevor, many years Master of the Rolls.&nbsp; He was
second son <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>of John Trevor, of Bynkinsalt, Denbighshire, Esq., by
an aunt of the infamous Chancellor Jeffreys, and was born about
1638.&nbsp; After a very lowly education, he was taken by a
relative, Arthur Trevor, a barrister, as his clerk.&nbsp; Here he
assiduously applied himself to the study of the law, and
afterwards entered the Inner Temple, and was called to the
bar.&nbsp; His advancement was very rapid, for, entering the
House of Commons, he upheld the Royal Prerogative to an extreme,
denying the right of Parliament to inquire into its
exercise.&nbsp; He took a prominent part in the unjust
prosecution of the unfortunate Lord Strafford, and strenuously
defended Jeffreys when he obstructed the right of petitioning in
the great controversy between the <i>Petitioners</i> and
<i>Abhorrers</i>.</p>
<p>When James II. called his only Parliament in May, 1685,
Trevor, who sat for Denbigh, was, through the Government
influence, elected Speaker. <a name="citation201"></a><a
href="#footnote201" class="citation">[201]</a>&nbsp; The new
Parliament, however, did not suit James, and at the commencement
of a second session was dissolved.&nbsp; Trevor&rsquo;s
obsequiousness was rewarded with the Mastership of the Rolls, an
office to which he was appointed <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>October 20th, 1685.&nbsp; It is said
he aimed now at the Chancellorship, and, with that object,
endeavoured to injure Jeffreys by aiding the outcry against him
on the occasion of the shameless case of Alderman Cornish.</p>
<p>In July, 1688, Trevor was sworn of the Privy Council; but
William of Orange soon after landing, with characteristic
meanness he held aloof, but when James returned after his first
flight, imagining a reaction was come, declared in his favour;
his hopes proved transitory, and he therefore joined the High
Tories, who wished to make William Regent only.&nbsp; He,
however, was declared King, and Trevor was removed from the
Rolls.</p>
<p>In 1690 a new Parliament was called, and Trevor joined the
more moderate of the two sections into which his party was
divided; and having offered to support the new King, and also
bring over partisans from the opposite camp, if restored to the
Speaker&rsquo;s chair, his proposal was agreed to; and so well
did he perform his part, that William in a few weeks appointed
him First Commissioner of the Great Seal, he still retaining the
Speakership, and in less than two years, his successor at the
Rolls <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>dying, he was restored to that position also.&nbsp; But
great inconvenience resulted, and on May 2nd, 1693, the Great
Seal was given to Somers.</p>
<p>In 1694 a great agitation was manifested in the House of
Commons, in the belief that the Court, and even the House itself,
was tainted with bribery.&nbsp; A committee was appointed, and on
the 12th March, 1695, Mr. Foley, the chairman, read its report,
which implicated Trevor; and a debate arising, a resolution was
proposed &ldquo;That Sir John Trevor, Speaker of this House,
receiving a gratuity of 1,000 guineas from the City of London,
after passing of the Orphans&rsquo; Bill, is guilty of a high
crime and misdemeanour.&rdquo;&nbsp; This motion Trevor had the
mortification to put from the chair, and the unparalleled
humiliation of declaring it unanimously carried.&nbsp; The House
immediately adjourned, and two days after he resigned the chair,
and on the 16th a motion for his expulsion from the House was
carried, and a new writ issued for the borough he represented. <a
name="citation203"></a><a href="#footnote203"
class="citation">[203]</a>&nbsp; He was, strangely enough,
permitted to retain <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>his Mastership of the Rolls, and no
further proceedings were taken against him.&nbsp; The rest of his
life he wisely spent in his judicial office, never again
withdrawing from it for politics.&nbsp; He died at his house in
Chancery Lane, May 20th, 1717, and was buried in the Rolls
Chapel.</p>
<p>Trevor&rsquo;s character, on the whole, is but a poor one; a
selfish ambition appears to have made him consider the end, and
not the means, the chief object of his care.</p>
<p>His circumstances, doubtless, compelled him to practise a
rigid economy, which, as he advanced in years and position, grew
into meanness.&nbsp; But it would be unjust not to mention the
redeeming points in his career.&nbsp; Lord Campbell states that
&ldquo;he was not only an upright but an enlightened judge, and
he pronounced many decrees which to this day are considered of
high authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; No charge of bribery or favouritism
was ever brought against him in the fulfilment of his judicial
duties.&nbsp; &ldquo;He had a villa at Knightsbridge,&rdquo; says
Lord Campbell, &ldquo;then almost a day&rsquo;s journey from
London, and he has been absurdly censured for occasionally
hearing cases at his private <a name="page205"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 205</span>residence, a practice all equity
judges sometimes must necessarily follow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
notwithstanding his niggardly disposition he founded six
almshouses in St. Martin&rsquo;s parish, Shropshire, and provided
also several other charities.&nbsp; He left issue an only
daughter, Anne, who married Michael Hill, of Hillsborough,
Esquire, who had two sons&mdash;Trevor, who became heir to the
Hills, and was ancestor of the Marquis of Downshire, and Arthur,
who inherited this property, assumed the name of Trevor, and was,
April 27th, 1765, raised to the peerage as Viscount Duncannon;
and from him the present freeholder is descended.</p>
<p>William Street was built about 1830.&nbsp; At No. 11 resided
for many years Lady Morgan, whose works occupy too distinguished
a place in our literature to need mention here.&nbsp; Mrs.
Gascoigne, in her poem, &ldquo;Belgravia,&rdquo; after sketching
the portrait of Mr. Higgins, as before given, describes Lady
Morgan as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Nor his the only pen Belgravia&rsquo;s
bounds<br />
Can boast, whose glory far and wide resounds!<br />
Endowed with manly powers, a woman&rsquo;s quill<br />
Can treat and master every theme at will;<br />
And in her wisdom&rsquo;s energetic scope,<br />
Put down a <i>Wiseman</i>, and unchair a <i>Pope</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>The
last line alludes to the controversy so cleverly sustained by her
ladyship, as to the genuineness of St. Peter&rsquo;s
Chair&mdash;a paper war, forming a capital chapter for a future
Disraeli, and the only amusing episode connected with the Papal
Aggression of 1851.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wilton Crescent</span> was commenced in
1826 by Mr. Seth Smith.&nbsp; At No. 24 for many years lived Mr.
Hallam, the celebrated historian.&nbsp; Here the great
<i>literati</i> of our times were wont to meet, for Mr.
Hallam&rsquo;s assemblies were of the most celebrated and
intellectual.&nbsp; At No. 16 the late Lord Dudley Stuart once
resided; it is now the residence of Mr. Richardson.&nbsp; No. 20
is the town-house of the Earl of Winchelsea, the
&ldquo;Protestant Earl;&rdquo; 39 was the residence of the Rev.
W. Bennett; and 30 of Lord John Russell, before his removal to
Chesham Place.&nbsp; Mr. Baron Watson resides at 38; and Mr.
Milner Gibson at No. 50.&nbsp; Lord Chewton, who so gallantly
fell in leading his men at the Battle of Alma, lived at 37.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Wilton Place</span>, occupying the site of
a cow-yard, into which there was a narrow entrance from the main
road, was built in 1827.&nbsp; At No. 15 Sir James Macdonald, the
gallant defender <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

the Hon. Thomas Stapleton, an antiquary, at 13; Mr. Westmacott at
21.&nbsp; The Chisholm used to occupy 35; and Miss Reynolds, the
actress, still resides at No. 4.</p>
<p>With Wilton Place these notices of Knightsbridge (proper)
close; mention of those eminent persons whose <i>locale</i>
cannot be traced will, I think, appropriately finish this
chapter.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Richard Bensley</span>, the celebrated
actor of the last century, resided the latter part of his life at
Knightsbridge.&nbsp; Appearing for the first time, in 1765, as
<i>Pierre</i> in &ldquo;Venice Preserved,&rdquo; he maintained a
good reputation as an actor for a lengthened period, not quitting
the stage till May 6th, 1796.&nbsp; He had the honour to deliver
Johnson&rsquo;s prologue to Goldsmith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good-Natured
Man;&rdquo; and as <i>Pierre</i>, <i>Iago</i>, and
<i>Hotspur</i>, his fame stood high among his
contemporaries.&nbsp; He was appointed barrack-master at
Knightsbridge (he had in early life been in the army), which
appointment he held till his death in 1817.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Thomas Harrison</span>, a poet, a friend
of Addison and Swift&mdash;&ldquo;my own creature,&rdquo; the
latter calls him&mdash;who brought over the celebrated <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Treaty of
Utrecht, died at Knightsbridge, on February 14th, 1713.&nbsp; He
was a <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Swift, who describes him,
in 1710, as &ldquo;a young fellow we are all fond of; a little
pretty fellow, with a great deal of wit, good sense, and good
nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was then tutor to a son of the Duke of
Queensbury on <i>forty pounds a year</i>; Swift introduced him to
the Ministry, and he was sent out as Secretary to the Embassy to
arrange the Peace of Utrecht, St. John presenting him with fifty
guineas to bear his expenses.&nbsp; Less than two years had
elapsed on February 11th, 1713, when Swift, returning from a
dinner, found a letter on his table from Harrison, telling him he
was ill, and desired to see him.&nbsp; He went in the morning,
found him suffering from fever and inflammation, harassed and
penniless; got thirty guineas for him from Bolingbroke, and a
Treasury order for &pound;100 of his arrears of salary.&nbsp; He
then removed him to Knightsbridge for change of air.&nbsp; On
February 14th, Swift writes,&mdash;&ldquo;I took Parnell (the
poet) this morning, and we walked to see poor Harrison.&nbsp; I
had the &pound;100 in my pocket.&nbsp; I told Parnell I was
afraid to knock at the door.&nbsp; My mind misgave me.&nbsp; I
knocked, <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>and his man, in tears, told me his master was dead an
hour before.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swift seems to have loved Harrison, and
felt his loss acutely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;what grief this is to me!&nbsp; I went to his mother, and
have been ordering things for his funeral with as little cost as
possible, to-morrow at ten at night.&nbsp; Lord Treasurer was
much concerned when I told him; I would not dine with Lord
Treasurer, or any one else.&nbsp; No loss ever grieved me so
much.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the next day he records, &ldquo;At ten at
night I was at his funeral, which I ordered to be as private as
possible.&nbsp; We had but one coach with four of us; and when it
was carrying us home, after the funeral, the braces broke, and we
were forced to sit in it, and have it held up, till my man went
for chairs, at eleven at night, in terrible rain.&rdquo; <a
name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a></p>
<p>Tickell, in one of his poems, mentions Harrison as&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That much loved youth, whom Utrecht&rsquo;s
walls confine;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and indeed, though little is known of him, he seems to have
been a favourite with his contemporaries.</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span><span
class="smcap">Bernard Lens</span>, miniature painter to George
II., retiring from his profession, settled at Knightsbridge,
where he died, December 30th, 1740.&nbsp; According to Vertue, he
was buried at Kensington, but his name does not appear on the
register.&nbsp; He was tutor to the celebrated Duke of
Cumberland, and excelled as a copyist of Rubens and Vandyke,
whose colouring he imitated admirably.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert Miller</span>, a loyalist in the
American War of Independence.&nbsp; He held two official
situations in Virginia, which he lost in the revolution.&nbsp; He

<p><span class="smcap">Francis Xavier D&rsquo;Oliveyra</span>, a
Portuguese chevalier, born in 1702, and filled the office of
Secretary to the Embassy at Vienna.&nbsp; He was persecuted by
the Inquisition on account of the publication of his travels, and
accordingly came to England, where he abjured the Romish
creed.&nbsp; Thus sacrificing fortune to the dictates of
conscience, he first encountered great difficulties, but found
friends, especially Archbishops Potter and Herring.&nbsp;
Frederick, Prince of Wales, also assigned him a pension.&nbsp; He
resided some years at Knightsbridge, which <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>he quitted
in 1775.&nbsp; He died October 11th, 1783. <a

<p>The <span class="smcap">Countess of Orrery</span>, friend of
Swift, died at Knightsbridge, October 27th, 1758.&nbsp; He
esteemed her highly &ldquo;as a person of very good
understanding, as any he knew of the sex.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his
will, Swift bequeathed to Lord Orrery &ldquo;the enamelled silver
plates to distinguish bottles of wine by,&rdquo; given him by his
&ldquo;excellent lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Seth Ward</span>, <span
class="smcap">Bishop of Salisbury</span>, had his town residence
at Knightsbridge.&nbsp; He was born April 15th, 1617, at Aspedon,
near Buntingford.&nbsp; Brought up at the Free School of his
native place, he was removed to Sydney Sussex College; but
refusing to subscribe the covenant, lost his fellowship, and in
1643 removed to the neighbourhood of London.&nbsp; Part of his
time he spent at Albury, in company with Oughte, and there the
two prosecuted their mathematical studies together.</p>
<p>In 1649, the Savilian Professors of Astronomy and Geometry
being removed from their offices by the Parliamentary
Commissioners, Ward was chosen to fill the former chair.&nbsp; On
this he took the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>and exerted
himself to restore the lectures, which had been greatly
neglected, and under him they speedily revived.</p>
<p>In 1652, he took his Doctor&rsquo;s Degree, and in 1659 was
made Principal of Jesus College, and afterwards Master of Trinity
College; but at the Restoration he was compelled to resign these
appointments.&nbsp; While at Oxford he gained the acquaintance of
some of the most eminent men of the time, especially of Wilkins,
afterwards Bishop of Chester.&nbsp; Their meetings led to the
formation of the Royal Society, which Ward strongly supported,
and of which he was one of the most efficient members.</p>
<p>Although he had taken office under the Commonwealth, he had
friends under the Monarchy, who were able to forward his
interests.&nbsp; Among them were Monk and Clarendon; and through
their intercessions he was presented to St. Lawrence Jewry, and
afterwards to the Precentorship of Exeter.&nbsp; His rise was now
rapid, for in 1661 he was appointed Dean, and in the ensuing year
Bishop of that Diocese.</p>
<p>In 1667 he was translated to the Bishopric of Salisbury, and
in the House of Lords, being an able speaker, took a prominent
part in the <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>debates.&nbsp; He has been accused of lending rather
too complying an ear to the Court, both in Parliament and the
rule of his diocese; probably these charges arose from his
supporting the ill-advised and tyrannical Conventicle Act, which
his predecessor, Bishop Earl, a man beloved by all parties, had
opposed.&nbsp; On the other hand, it must be borne in mind he
approved of the opposition to James II., and to two copies of the
petition his signature was affixed.</p>
<p>His residence, when his duties called him to the metropolis,
was at Knightsbridge, and here he was visited by all the leading
literary and scientific men of the day.&nbsp; Evelyn, in his
&ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; March 25th, 1674, writes, &ldquo;I dined at
Knightsbridge, with the Bishops of Salisbury, Chester, and
Lincoln, my old friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; The celebrated Isaac Barrow
was also a frequent guest; and it was at the Bishop&rsquo;s table
he was seized with the illness which in a short time ended his
days.&nbsp; The celebrated Sir Charles Scarborough was another
friend&mdash;he also was Ward&rsquo;s medical adviser; and Burnet
states he was at Knightsbridge with him when the Queen&rsquo;s
coach came for him to attend her at the birth of the future
Pretender.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>The
Bishop&rsquo;s health towards the close of his life was very
indifferent, and at length he was deprived of his faculties
altogether, and died at Knightsbridge, January 6, 1689, in his
seventy-second year.&nbsp; He was a very learned man, as his
writings abundantly show, and a very charitable one.&nbsp; At his
native place he founded almshouses, and also left a sum for
apprenticing its poor boys.&nbsp; I know nothing more beautiful
or pure in a great man&rsquo;s character than to see him
remembering in his old age those villagers among whom, in a
comparatively humble sphere, he first drew breath.&nbsp; Such
conduct indicates a benevolent mind and a good heart; and such
public acts which seem to show a different spirit, I would rather
attribute to a temporary fear or extraneous motive, other than
the genuine constitution of the mind.&nbsp; A life of Ward was
published by Dr. Pope, author of the celebrated ballad,
&ldquo;The Old Man&rsquo;s Wish.&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[214]</a></p>
<p>William Penn resided at Knightsbridge, at <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>No. 8, St.
George&rsquo;s Place, it is said; in order to be nearer the
Court, where he was a great favourite with the Queen; he left it
in 1706.&nbsp; Sir John Chardin, the famous Persian Ambassador of
the time of Charles II., lived once in this same house.&nbsp; So
imbued was he by his travels with Eastern ideas, that on Persian
festivals he used to illuminate his windows with candles.&nbsp;
He was buried at Chiswick, 29th December, 1713.&nbsp; The clever
but unfortunate George Anne Bellamy also lived here in
1747.&nbsp; Dr. Richard Wright, F.R.S., and physician to St.
George&rsquo;s Hospital, died here, October 14th, 1786.&nbsp; J.
Marshall, a botanist and gardener, and well known as a writer on
such subjects, lived at Knightsbridge many years; and Edward
Wakefield, author of &ldquo;Ireland, Political and
Statistical,&rdquo; died here, May 18th, 1854, aged
eighty-six.&nbsp; John Allen, of Knightsbridge, in 1685, left to
the parish of Hammersmith 10s. annually to twenty poor
people.&nbsp; The Countess of Yarmouth, mistress of George II.,
also numbered among its inhabitants.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">BELGRAVIA.</span></h2>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Belgravia!
that fair spot of ground<br />
Where all that worldlings covet most is found!<br />
Of this stupendous town&mdash;this mighty heart!<br />
Of England&rsquo;s frame&mdash;<i>the fashionable</i>
part!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Belgravia</span>: <span class="smcap">a
Poem</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Between</span> the Hamlet of Knightsbridge
and the district of Pimlico are a number of streets and squares
to which the fashionable term of Belgravia has been given, and
which is now the recognised name of the locality.&nbsp; Southward
of the old King&rsquo;s Road has for 200 years been known as
Pimlico.&nbsp; To this boundary, sanctioned by usage, I shall
adhere; considering only those places as in Belgravia between
this line, and one formed from St. George&rsquo;s Hospital, by
Grosvenor Crescent and Motcomb Street; while the east boundary is
Grosvenor Place; and the west, the sewer.&nbsp; The name is
derived from a title of the Marquis of Westminster, <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>taken from
a village in Leicestershire, where he has great property.&nbsp;
Halkin, Motcomb, and Kinnerton Streets, also derive their names
from properties of the Marquis; Eaton Square from his seat, and
Wilton Place, &amp;c., from the title of his brother.</p>
<p>I need hardly say Belgravia is yet in its youth; of history,
strictly speaking, it really has none.&nbsp; Where now stands
this</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Oasis of the
fashionable west,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>was, thirty years ago, nought but marshy fields&mdash;fields
in a very forlorn condition, covered with rank grass and weeds in
full luxuriance; bounded by mud-banks, and almost wholly given up
to sheep and asses.&nbsp; I cannot do better than let the lady,
who has chosen Belgravia for her theme, describe its former
aspect.</p>
<blockquote><p>Time was, when here, where palaces now stand,<br
/>
Where dwell at ease the magnates of the land,<br />
A barren waste existed, fetid, damp,<br />
Cheered by the ray of no enlivening lamp!<br />
A marshy spot, where not one patch of green,<br />
No stunted shrub, nor sickly flower was seen;<br />
But all things base, the refuse of the town,<br />
Loathsome and rank, in one foul mass were thrown;<br />
Breeding the vapours that in fever&rsquo;s hour<br />
Lend to Disease its desolating power,<br />
<a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>And
quench the life of thousands, like the blight,<br />
Noiseless, but sure, that in a single night<br />
Upon the blossoms&rsquo; opening bloom descends,<br />
And brooding rests, till all their promise ends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Belgravia was and still is within the manor of Ebury, and in
ancient times within the parish of St.
Martin&rsquo;s-in-the-Fields.&nbsp; It now belongs to St.
George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square, but subdivided; about half
pertaining each to St. Paul&rsquo;s, Knightsbridge, and St.
Peter&rsquo;s, Pimlico.&nbsp; The early history of this manor has
been already noticed; now for its modern.</p>
<p>King George III., on taking up his residence at Buckingham
House, wished to purchase the fields lying immediately
contiguous, in order to prevent buildings being erected so as to
overlook his garden.&nbsp; The Lock Hospital stood then alone,
but it was apparent that the ground would soon be occupied, if
the King should fix his abode so near.&nbsp; He therefore entered
into a negotiation for its purchase, but George Grenville, then
Minister, refused to sanction the expenditure of the sum
demanded, viz., &pound;20,000, and Grosvenor Place was
accordingly commenced building in 1767.&nbsp; The streets running
from this line were terminated by <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>high mud banks, which formed a
boundary no traveller ventured over.&nbsp; The other side formed
a part of the Five Fields, and it was not till 1825 that the
determination was come to to cover it with houses.&nbsp; Mr.
Thomas Cubitt and Mr. Seth Smith then took leases from the
Marquis of Westminster, and Belgravia speedily arose.</p>
<p>The Five Fields was an ominous name to our forefathers.&nbsp;
Addison, in the &ldquo;Tatler&rdquo; (No. 34), refers to them as
the place &ldquo;where the robbers lie in wait;&rdquo; and pages
might easily be covered with the records of the frightful crimes
here committed.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s Road, anciently only a
trackway for the use of the farmers and gardeners, was the only
road across.&nbsp; A lane led to it from Hyde Park Corner, and
other paths intersected the fields into five large
parts&mdash;hence the name; but it was not till Charles II. found
the road a near way from Whitehall to Hampton Court that any
public way was formed, and not then till after some discussion
between the Government and the parishioners of Chelsea.&nbsp; In
the reign of George I. disputes arose as to the right of way;
but, after inquiry, the Government acknowledged <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>the claims
of the inhabitants to be just. <a name="citation220"></a><a
href="#footnote220" class="citation">[220]</a>&nbsp; In the
documents relating to this dispute the fields are said to be
open, and the bridge, then called &ldquo;Bloody Bridge,&rdquo;
now known as Grosvenor Bridge, only &ldquo;a footbridge, with a
plank or board,&rdquo; till built in a regular manner in the time
of Charles II.&nbsp; The road across the fields was very
insecure; and for many years, under a royal order, fifty-two
privates, and six non-commissioned officers, half every alternate
night, patrolled the ground.&nbsp; On grand gala nights at
Ranelagh the number was greater; but on all occasions it was
customary for persons wishing to cross to wait for a sufficient
number to meet together to ensure mutual protection, and then,
with two men carrying lanterns on long poles, and who obtained
their living by such service, sallying across under their
guidance.&nbsp; Such a relation almost forces a smile now; but it
must be borne in mind that no houses were situated along the
King&rsquo;s Road a hundred years since.&nbsp; It was also then
very circuitous, running from the Palace garden wall along the
present north garden of Eaton Square to Sloane Square.&nbsp; Its
<a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>dangers
were very great, as the newspapers of the last century afford
melancholy proof.&nbsp; I give one specimen:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On Saturday evening last, February 24th, a
servant belonging to Mrs. Temple was robbed and barbarously
wounded near Bloody Bridge in the King&rsquo;s Road, leading from
Chelsea.&nbsp; Her Royal Highness the Princess Amelia coming from
Hampton Court, hearing a man groaning, ordered her servant to
stop; and it proving to be the man above-mentioned, he was taken
behind the coach and brought to town; and her Highness ordered
all possible care to be taken of him.&rdquo; <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bloody Bridge seems to have gained its fearful character
early; in Chelsea register is the following notice of the
name:&mdash;&ldquo;1590.&nbsp; John Dukes was this year enjoyned
to make a Causie at <i>bloody</i> Gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Dartquineuve, the friend of Pope, and to whom Dodsley
was once footman, was appointed surveyor of the King&rsquo;s
Private Roads, in 1731, in room of General Watkins.&nbsp;
Pass-tickets of copper were issued in that <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>year, and
are prized by the curious in such matters.</p>
<p>Duellists also sought the Fire Fields, and Aubrey tells of one
meeting near to Ebury farm, in the time of Charles I., between
Lord Mohun and a foreign nobleman.&nbsp; The former was killed,
not without suspicion of foul play; and the credulous antiquary
relates that at the time of the duel, his mistress saw him
approach her bed, draw the curtains, and go away without
speaking!</p>
<p>Great numbers of the lower orders used to frequent the Five
Fields, to indulge themselves with the brutal sports so prevalent
formerly among them.&nbsp; Near where Coleshill Street now stands
was a famous resort for cock-fighting, and every Good Friday
numbers came to witness the barbarity.&nbsp; Duck-hunting in the
ponds and bull and bear-baiting were also largely carried on; the
head-quarters of the latter being at a house by the Willow Walk,
once the habitation of the notorious Jerry Abershaw.</p>
<p>It is pleasant to quit such recollections for those of a purer
kind.&nbsp; The old herbalists frequented these fields, where,
they tell, the <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>&ldquo;wild clary&rdquo; grew plentifully; and along
the river&rsquo;s bank the &ldquo;bitter cresses&rdquo; in great
perfection.&nbsp; And Swift, walking to London from his Chelsea
residence in 1711, mentions the hay-making in the fields;
&ldquo;it smells so sweet,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;as we walk
through the flowery meads;&rdquo; but he spoils the idea by
telling us that &ldquo;the hay-making nymphs are perfect
drabs.&rdquo;&nbsp; The market gardens in the Five Fields, though
not very numerous, were very valuable, being devoted chiefly to
the culture of the asparagus and the rarer vegetables.&nbsp;
Norden, in 1593, tells us,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The deepe, and dirtie, loathsome soyle,<br
/>
Yields golden gaine to painefull toyle;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and that the labourer &ldquo;will refuse a pallace to droyle
in these golden puddles.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nursery ground of
Messrs. Allen and Rogers was in being so late as 1832, adjoining
to the King&rsquo;s Road.&nbsp; The father of Mr. Redgrave, the
distinguished artist, resided in a house on the King&rsquo;s
Road, and here his eminent son was born.</p>
<p>One historical reminiscence will conclude the notices of the
fields.&nbsp; Clarendon tells us that he, Hampden, Pym, Marten,
and Fiennes <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>had dined together at Pym&rsquo;s lodgings, when
Fiennes proposed a ride into these fields.&nbsp; Accordingly they
set off; and the conversation turning on the Episcopacy Bill,
Fiennes asked Hyde why he so passionately adhered to the Church,
Hyde&rsquo;s reply was an expression of doubt as to the stability
of the State, or of religion itself, if the government of the
Church was altered; and Fiennes rejoining that much blood would
be shed ere that would be submitted to, Hyde (Clarendon) remarks
it was the first positive declaration he had heard from any
particular man of the party.&nbsp; Hampden, Pym, and other
leaders of those eventful times, are said to have sought the air
and private intercommunication in the Five Fields.&nbsp; This
anecdote concludes this early portion of Belgravia&rsquo;s
history; the reader&rsquo;s attention will now be drawn to its
streets and squares.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Belgrave Square</span> was commenced in
1825, and designed by Basevi.&nbsp; It is 684 ft. in length, by
637 ft. in breadth.&nbsp; The two detached mansions on the
western side were designed by H. E. Kendall.&nbsp; The one in the
south-west was originally built for Mr. Kemp, of Kemp Town;
afterwards it was occupied by <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Lady Harriett Drummond, the Marquis
of Tweeddale, and in 1837 became the residence of Lord Hill, for
many years Commander-in Chief.&nbsp; After his death the late
Earl Ducie lived here, and on his decease, in 1853, the house was
sold, and enlarged to its present size.&nbsp; The mansion in the
north-west was the residence of the late Earl Brownlow.</p>
<p>General Sir George Murray, the friend of Wellington and Peel,
lived at No. 5, and died there in 1846, respected and
regretted.&nbsp; No. 2 was the residence of the late James
Goding, Esq., who formed a fine collection of paintings, and
other works of art.&nbsp; No. 6 is the Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s,
and at No. 9 resides the celebrated Countess Dowager of
Essex.&nbsp; At No. 10 lived M. Drouyn de l&rsquo;Huys, while
Ambassador at St. James&rsquo; from France.&nbsp; At 16 resides
Sir Roderick Murchison, and at 18 lived the late Earl of
Ellesmere.&nbsp; No. 36, sometimes called Ingestrie House, was in
1840 the residence of H.R.H. the Duchess of Kent, and at present
of Colonel Douglas Pennant.&nbsp; Mr. Labouchere at 27, the
Archbishop of York 41, Sir M. S. Stewart at 42, the Duke of
Montrose, Mr. Abel Smith, and Field-Marshal Lord <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>Combermere,
are also residents of Belgrave Square.</p>
<p>The last of the Dukes of Gordon died at his residence here,
May 28th, 1836, aged 66; and Mr. Scrope, last male of a family
illustrious in our historic annals, lived at No. 13.&nbsp; He was
author of &ldquo;Days of Deer Stalking,&rdquo; published in 1839;
and &ldquo;Days and Nights of Salmon Fishing,&rdquo; published in
1843.&nbsp; Mr. Scrope died in Belgrave Square, July 20th, 1852,
in the 81st year of his age.&nbsp; His son-in-law, Mr. Poulett
Scrope, M.P., and author of the &ldquo;History of Castle
Combe,&rdquo; soon after quitted this mansion for one at
Prince&rsquo;s Gate.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chapel Street</span>, so named from the
Chapel attached to the Lock Hospital, which abutted on it, was
completed about 1811.&nbsp; Legh Richmond, while Chaplain of the
Lock, resided in this street.&nbsp; Writing to his wife, he says,
&ldquo;It is surrounded by fields, has a very pleasing prospect,
charming air, great retirement and quietness, with a little
garden, a remarkably neat exterior, and as neat and comfortable
an interior.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nor was he the only one who found in
Chapel Street a comfortable and happy home: the celebrated
comedian, Gentleman <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>Jones as he is called generally, for
many years lived at No. 14.&nbsp; &ldquo;The very aspect of their
rooms is exhilarating,&rdquo; writes Lady Chatterton,
&ldquo;though small, and furnished without any show or
expense.&nbsp; A vine which grows at the back of the house, half
conceals the windows with its luxuriant branches; and some fresh
flowers in the rooms are fit emblems of those who reared
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation227"></a><a href="#footnote227"
class="citation">[227]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Jones acquired fame both as an actor and author, but in
his later years employed himself as a teacher of elocution.&nbsp;
He died in Chapel Street, and lies buried in St. Peter&rsquo;s
vaults.&nbsp; A marble tablet to his memory, at the entrance to
the Church, bears the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Beneath rest the mortal remains of Richard
Jones, for more than forty years in public life, a dramatic
performer, he was admired; as in private life respected as a
teacher of elocution, he was a public Benefactor.&nbsp; As a
Christian and a Man his conduct was exemplary.&nbsp; He died 20th
of August, 1851, aged 72.&nbsp; Here also repose the remains of
Sarah, his wife.&nbsp; She died 18th of June, 1850, aged
71.&nbsp; And Eliza Jane his sister, who died 29th November,
1828, aged 40.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>General Sir W. K. Grant, one of the eight British officers who
saved the Emperor of Germany <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>from capture, on the plains of
Cambresis, in 1794, and who otherwise saw severe service in the
last great war, died in 1852, at his residence, No, 24, Chapel
Street.&nbsp; At her residence, in this street, also died, in

works on the Government of India; Sir Robert Gardiner, one of the
bravest of the old Peninsulas; Sir H. Duncan, son of the victor
of Camperdown, and himself a <i>tar</i> of true British stamp,
died here in 1836.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Troubridge was another of
that mighty school; he fought with Nelson at Copenhagen, and
elsewhere, and died here in 1852.&nbsp; Sir William Molesworth,
one of our ablest and most advanced statesmen of modern times,
and who has secured to himself a permanent position in our
literature, died at his residence (No. 87) in 1855.</p>
<p>Among present residents are Dr. Lushington (18), Sir Erskine
Perry (36), Sir George Grey (14), Mr. Justice Wightman (38), Mr.
Heywood (5), Sir Arthur Elton, M.P., and the Bishop of
Hereford.</p>
<p>At No. 80, the residence of Captain Massingberd, the Hungarian
statesman, Kossuth, stayed on his first arrival in this country,
in the autumn of 1851.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Eaton Place West</span>.&mdash;General Sir

1852.&nbsp; Mr. Collier, M.P. (2), and Mr. H. F. Chorley (13),
live in this street.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Eaton Square</span> was commenced in 1827,
but not wholly completed till 1853.&nbsp; It is 1,637 ft. long by
a breadth of 371 ft.&nbsp; Among its distinguished residents may
be noticed the late Lord Chancellor Truro, who died at his
residence (No. 83) in 1853.&nbsp; Mr. Henry Redhead Yorke, at 81;
Lord Alvanley, of celebrity in the days of the fourth George, at
62; General Sir Thomas Bradford, and Admiral Sir Edward
Codrington, the victor of Navarino.</p>
<p>The late Ralph Bernal, Esq., resided at 75, and here formed
one of the most splendid collections of ancient art ever brought
together.&nbsp; He died here in 1853.&nbsp; No. 71 is the
residence (official) of the Speaker of the House of Commons; in
one year, says Mr. Cunningham, the rent, rates, and taxes of this
house amounted to &pound;964.</p>
<p>Among present residents in Eaton Square are the Earl of
Ellenborough at No. 115, Sir Frederick Thesiger, now Lord
Chelmsford (7), Mr. Justice Willes (16), Sir John Pakington (41),

Cardwell (74), Baron Martin (75), Sir Augustus Clifford (92), Sir
W. Clay (93), and General Codrington, our Commander-in-Chief at
the capture of Sebastopol, at 110.</p>
<p>At the east end stands St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, built in
1826, and denounced by Mr. Cunningham as one of the
&ldquo;ugliest in all London.&rdquo;&nbsp; The site is an
excellent one, few superior in the metropolis; it is a just
source of regret, therefore, that a more creditable design was
not chosen.&nbsp; It was designed by Henry Hakewill, in the Ionic
Order, and consecrated by Dr. Howley, then Bishop of London, July
27th, 1827.&nbsp; It was burnt down in 1835, when the
altar-piece, &ldquo;Christ crowned with Thorns,&rdquo; a good
specimen of Hilton, R.A., was with difficulty saved.&nbsp; It was
presented to the Church by the British Institution.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grosvenor Crescent</span> is still
unfinished.&nbsp; Here reside the Rev. A. P. Stanley, Sir Charles
Trevelyan, and at No. 1 the Earl of Clarendon, late Secretary of
State for Foreign Affairs.&nbsp; The Crescent is ultimately to be
continued to open into Grosvenor Place, and thus it will <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>form the
main entrance to Belgravia; an improvement very greatly
needed.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grosvenor Place</span>.&mdash;The story
pertaining to the foundation of this street has been told
already.&nbsp; Originally the houses were built no further than
the Lock Hospital, which occupied the site of the Grosvenor Place
Houses.&nbsp; At the bottom, where the junction with the
King&rsquo;s Road was formed, was a cluster of mean dwellings,
and one inn, known as &ldquo;The Feathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At No. 1, Dr. Lane&rsquo;s celebrated School of Anatomy and
Medicine has for many years been established.&nbsp; No. 4
originally formed two houses, which were thrown together by the
late Earl of Egremont, who here first formed the splendid
collection of pictures now at Petworth.&nbsp; He was a great
patron of English artists, and an excellent judge of their
productions.&nbsp; Haydon, one of those he had befriended,
declares he &ldquo;never saw such a character, or such a man, nor
were there ever many.&nbsp; &lsquo;Live and let live&rsquo; seems
to be the Earl&rsquo;s motto.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Egremont died in
November, 1837. <a name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232"

<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>The
mansion at the north corner of Halkin Street is that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Where
the Howards&rsquo; noble race<br />
For many a year have made their resting place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first nobleman of this title who resided here was
Frederick, the fifth earl.&nbsp; He was born in 1748, and died in
1825, and is the nobleman often mentioned by Boswell as gaining
Johnson&rsquo;s praise for his literary performances.&nbsp; But
however valuable these may be considered, he owes his literary
immortality to the attacks made on him by Byron.&nbsp; He was
guardian to the poet, who dedicated to him his &ldquo;Hours of
Idleness,&rdquo; which the Earl is said to have coolly received,
an affront which deeply rankled in Byron&rsquo;s
breast&mdash;causing a wound his mother did her best to
widen.&nbsp; Byron, however, seems to have forgotten his
animosity, for in his &ldquo;English Bards and Scotch
Reviewers,&rdquo; as originally intended for the press, he
compliments Carlisle:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On one alone Apollo deigns to smile,<br />
And crowns a new Roscommon in Carlisle.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the intended honour was not permitted to remain.&nbsp;
Receiving, as he considered, a fresh <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>slight, Byron erased the praise, for
the vituperative sarcasm still to be read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let Stott, Matilda, and the rest<br />
Of Grub-street and of Grosvenor-place the best,<br />
Scrawl on, till death release us from the strain,<br />
Or common sense asserts her rights again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the poet regretted the severity, and afterwards, in his
noble tribute to Major Howard, gave utterance to his
repentance;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Their praise is hymned by loftier harps
than mine;<br />
Yet one I would select from that proud throng,<br />
Partly because they blend me with his line,<br />
And partly that I did his sire some wrong.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And of the Major he writes with rapturous
eloquence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;When
shower&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The death-bolts deadliest the thinn&rsquo;d files
along,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Even where the thickest of war&rsquo;s tempest
lour&rsquo;d,<br />
They reach&rsquo;d no nobler breast than thine, young gallant
Howard.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Byron&rsquo;s staunchest friend, Hobhouse&mdash;now Lord
Broughton&mdash;lived about No. 7, when colleague with Burdett in
the representation of Westminster; so also did Lady Ossory, the
correspondent of Horace Walpole.&nbsp; Writing to her, on
February 1st, 1775, he says:&mdash;&ldquo;I hope this is the last
letter I shall send you before you land at <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Hyde Park
Corner turnpike.&nbsp; You will have a very good neighbourhood
there; Lord and Lady Apsley are mighty agreeable
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. 15 in 1773 was the Duke of Athol&rsquo;s; the Marquis of
Titchfield, Lord-Lieutenant of the County fifty years ago, also
resided in Grosvenor Place, as did Mr. Orby Hunter, a leading man
in the <i>ton</i> in the days of George IV.</p>
<p>No. 44 is the residence of the Hanoverian Minister, and here
his Sovereign stayed during his visit to London in 1853.&nbsp;
No. 24 is the Bishop of Worcester&rsquo;s, and No. 46 Sir James
Graham&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Earl Stanhope, the historian, resided some
years at No. 41, but now at No. 3, Grosvenor Place Houses.&nbsp;
The centre of these three is Sir Anthony Rothschild&rsquo;s, the
other Lord Harry Vane&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Near to the south end of Grosvenor Place stood, for above a
century, a small hospital for invalided soldiers.&nbsp; The poet
Armstrong, friend of Thomson, was in 1746 appointed physician to
it.&nbsp; The establishment was closed when the improvements here
were contemplated about 1846.&nbsp; Adjoining to it was
&ldquo;The Feathers,&rdquo; to which a curious anecdote is
attached.&nbsp; A Lodge <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>of Odd Fellows, or some similar
society, was in the habit of holding its meetings in a room at
&ldquo;The Feathers,&rdquo; and on one occasion when a new member
was being initiated in the mysteries thereof, in rushed two
persons, whose abrupt and unauthorised entrance threw the whole
assemblage into an uproar.&nbsp; Summary punishment was proposed
by an expeditious kick into the street; but, just as it was about
to be bestowed, the secretary recognised one of the intruders as
George, Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV.&nbsp;
Circumstances instantly changed: it indeed was he, out on a
nocturnal excursion; and accordingly it was proposed and carried
that the Prince and his companion should be admitted
members.&nbsp; The Prince was chairman the remainder of the
evening; and the chair in which he sat, ornamented, in
consequence, with the plume, is still preserved in the parlour of
the modern inn in Grosvenor Street West, and over it hangs a
coarsely executed portrait of the Prince in the robes of the
order.&nbsp; The inn, the hospital, and various small tenements
were removed in 1851, when the present stately erections were
immediately commenced.&nbsp; On the ground being cleared away,
various coins, <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>old horse-shoes, a few implements of warfare, and some
human remains were discovered.</p>
<p>At the intersection of the cross-roads at the end of Grosvenor
Place, suicides were subjected to the revolting burial then
awarded by the law.&nbsp; The last person on whom the law was
carried out here was named Griffiths, the son of a colonel in the
army, who had first murdered his father, and then destroyed
himself.&nbsp; This took place on June 27th, 1823.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Halkin Street</span>.&mdash;The north side
is chiefly occupied by Mortimer House, the residence of the late
Earl Fitzwilliam, and by Belgrave Chapel, built in 1812.&nbsp;
Its ministers have been the Rev. John Pitman, author of
&ldquo;Practical Lectures on the Gospel of St. John,&rdquo; the
Revs. J. Thackeray, J. Jennings, and the present minister, the
Rev. W. Thorpe, D.D.</p>
<p>The detached mansion at the corner, numbered as 49, Belgrave
Square, finished in 1850, is the residence of Mr. Sidney
Herbert.&nbsp; The premises now occupied by Messrs. Wimbush were
those in which the same business was conducted by Mr. Vernon, the
munificent patron of modern British art.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Halkin Street West</span> contains a small
chapel, <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>now belonging to the National Scottish Church, and in
which Dr. Cumming occasionally preaches.&nbsp; Its present
minister is the Rev. L. Macbeth.&nbsp; Built by Mr. Seth Smith,
it was originally attached to the Church of England, under the
ministry of the Rev. J. Gibson.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lock Hospital</span> (The), which formerly
stood on the site of Grosvenor Place Houses, was built in 1746,
and patients admitted on January 31st, 1747, for the first
time.&nbsp; The Institution included an asylum for the reception
of penitent females, founded in 1787, and a chapel, built in
1764, with the primary view of aiding the income by its pew
rents.&nbsp; The chapel was always celebrated for the powerful
and popular preachers who occupied its pulpit, among whom may be
mentioned Martin Madan, Thomas Scott, editor and commentator of
the Scriptures, and C. E. De Coetlogon; while Legh Richmond,
Romaine, Rowland Hill, and the celebrated Dr. Dodd, have often
preached here.&nbsp; Of these, the one most connected with this
locality was the Rev. Martin Madan.</p>

<p>His father was M.P. for Wootton Basset, and Groom of the
Bedchamber to Frederick, Prince of Wales; his mother, a daughter
of <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>Spence Cowper, and niece of the celebrated Chancellor;
an accomplished woman, and authoress of several poems of
considerable merit.&nbsp; Martin was originally brought up to the
bar, which he forsook for the Church; was ordained, became
Chaplain to the Lock, and one of the most popular ministers of
the day.&nbsp; He was a distant relation of the poet Cowper, who
first imbibed from him those religious principles which
afterwards formed so predominant a feature of his mind.</p>
<p>In 1780 his popularity received a severe blow from the
publication of his &ldquo;Thelyphthora,&rdquo; a singular work in
defence of polygamy.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that the work
was issued with good intentions, but the manner of treating the
subject was at least novel, and especially so in a clergyman.</p>
<p>Madan was the author of various other works, and likewise of
some repute as a musical composer.&nbsp; Many of the tunes and
chants in the &ldquo;Lock Hymn Book&rdquo; have his initials
attached.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Song of Miriam&rdquo; is, perhaps, his
most popular piece.&nbsp; At the same time, mention must be made
of his composition to Pope&rsquo;s Ode, known as &ldquo;Vital
Spark,&rdquo; also of the piece <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>&ldquo;Before Jehovah&rsquo;s awful
Throne.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have heard him spoken of by elderly folks
with deep respect; and whatever his shortcomings may have been, a
want of charity was not among them.&nbsp; That he was equally
respected in high society may be inferred from his friendship
with Lord Chancellor Bathurst, who gave him a chaplaincy.</p>
<p>He died at Epsom in the 64th year of his age, and was buried
at Kensington, May 8th, 1791.</p>
<p>The connection of Legh Richmond with the Lock was of very
short duration.&nbsp; He was induced to accept the minor office
of assistant to the Rev. Thomas Fry, then chaplain, and while
here attracted the notice of Ambrose Serle, author of
&ldquo;Hor&aelig; Solitari&aelig;,&rdquo; a constant attendant of
the chapel.&nbsp; Serle was applied to by Mrs. Fuller to
recommend her a pious and practical clergyman to fill her living
of Turvey; he immediately recommended Richmond, and thus it was
that estimable man obtained the position he filled with such
great credit to himself and the Church, and benefit to his
people.&nbsp; His ministrations here extended only from February
to October 1805.</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>Wilberforce strongly supported this Institution, and
frequently attended the Chapel.&nbsp; He occasionally alludes to
it in his &ldquo;Diary;&rdquo; and Legh Richmond mentions
observing him at the communion-table on one occasion, with a
negro at his side, a coincidence which he afterwards found was
quite accidental.&nbsp; The incident was not without a
lesson!</p>

<p>The buildings were of brick, and as plain as they possibly

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> district parish of St.
Paul&rsquo;s, Knightsbridge, stretching southward to the Thames,
embraces in its bounds a considerable part of Pimlico.&nbsp; When
St. Barnabas&rsquo; Church was built, for the local management of
the parish, this southern portion was allotted to its
minister&rsquo;s care, and therefore I follow a division most
suitable for my plan, and give a brief outline of the history of
this part of the parish, in order that my notice may not be
incomplete.</p>
<p>Of course, I do not intend to describe the suburb now called
Pimlico as a whole, but only that portion of it within the
district of St. Paul&rsquo;s; yet I cannot even do so without <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>touching on
one or two items of general history: and first, then, for the
name.</p>
<p>The first mention of the name Pimlico appears in the parish
books of St. Martin in the year 1626. <a
name="citation245a"></a><a href="#footnote245a"
class="citation">[245a]</a>&nbsp; The ancient name of the place
was Eybury, from the manor of Eia or Eye, signifying water; a
most appropriate name for a spot bounded on three sides by
running streams.&nbsp; There was a Manor House once existing,
which we may infer was of some importance, from its being one of
those houses for which a licence to crenellate or fortify was
granted.&nbsp; This privilege was granted in 1307 to John de
Benstede, by Edward I. <a name="citation245b"></a><a
href="#footnote245b" class="citation">[245b]</a>&nbsp; Hence the
addition of <i>bury</i> to the original name of Eye or Eia, such
addition meaning fortifications.</p>
<p>But to the name.&nbsp; The true explanation of its origin is
to be found in a rare, if not unique tract, entitled, &ldquo;News
from Hogsdon,&rdquo; 1598:&mdash;&ldquo;Have at thee then, my
merrie boys, and hie for old Ben Pimlicoe&rsquo;s nut
brown.&rdquo; <a name="citation245c"></a><a href="#footnote245c"
class="citation">[245c]</a>&nbsp; This &ldquo;old Ben
Pimlico,&rdquo; of Hoxton, kept, in <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>the days of Queen Bess, a right
famous hostelrie, a popular place of resort, as numerous
allusions in the dramatists <a name="citation246"></a><a
href="#footnote246" class="citation">[246]</a> of the period
testify.&nbsp; Pimlico Walk still exists at Hoxton, and doubtless
indicates the pathway along which the pleasure-seekers wended
their way to Old Ben&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>It is evident in the above quotation that a <i>person</i> is
alluded to; but the word frequently expresses a <i>drink</i>,
most probably derived from this worthy.&nbsp; This is evident
from the following verses:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let Hogsdon&rsquo;s scrapers on their
base,<br />
Sound fum&mdash;fum&mdash;fum&mdash;from tattered case,<br />
Nor Mean nor Treble now take place,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Tenor.</p>
<p>A Counter-Tenor is that note.<br />
Tho&rsquo; easy&mdash;&rsquo;tis ne&rsquo;er sung by rote,<br />
But got with wetting well your throat<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With claret.</p>
<p>Or stout March beer, or Windsor ale,<br />
Or Labour-in-Vain (so seldom stale),<br />
Or <i>Pimlico</i>, whose too great sale<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Did mar it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">The Counter
Rat</span>, 1670.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>This
Ben Pimlico, and the ale named after him, are both spoken of with
equal laudation by the dramatists&mdash;by Ben Jonson more
especially, who lived in the neighbourhood, and doubtless was
familiar with both.&nbsp; But in his play of &ldquo;The
Alchemist,&rdquo; the allusion, I think, points to a bygone
place:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Lovewit</i>: The neighbours tell me all
here that the doors<br />
Have still been open&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Face</i>: How, sir!</p>
<p><i>Lovewit</i>: Gallants, men and women,<br />
And of all sorts, tag-rag, been seen to flock here<br />
In threwes, these ten weeks, as to a <i>second Hogsdon</i><br />
<i>In days of Pimlico and Eyebright</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This evidence of Jonson I think conclusive that the original
Ben Pimlico&rsquo;s had gone.&nbsp; The question is where; and my
reply is, to Ebury.&nbsp; The reasons are&mdash;</p>
<p>1st.&nbsp; We had in this locality a pathway known as the
Willow Walk, and there is such yet remaining at Hoxton.</p>
<p>2nd.&nbsp; The movement of places of amusement to the western
suburbs commenced in the time of James I.&nbsp; At this time the
Exchange, Islington, and Hoxton began to lose their charms, and
pleasure-folk went to Spring Garden, the Mulberry Garden,
&amp;c.</p>
<p><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>Though this argument, if such it can be called, is
wholly inferential, I do not think there is anything to oppose to
it, unless the number of places called Pimlico <a
name="citation248"></a><a href="#footnote248"
class="citation">[248]</a> tells against the view taken.&nbsp;
But here, again, the probability is that they borrowed their
names from the one at Hoxton, because of its popularity; and the
coincidence of the Willow Walk is moreover wanting: what I argue
for is, that on the decay, for some reason or other, of Ben
Pimlico&rsquo;s establishment at Hoxton, he, or some one
belonging to it, came to Ebury, formed his Willow Walk leading to
the house, and his popularity being so great, the village became
gradually to be called after him, and its ancient appellation
imperceptibly lost.</p>
<p>That part of Pimlico now in St. Paul&rsquo;s district was, in
the last century, a complete moral wilderness.&nbsp; As is
apparent to the present day, the dwellings were of the meanest
character; and it was only the infamous who long lived
here.&nbsp; Jerry Abershaw lived in a house along the Willow
Walk; and Maclean the highwayman, whom the ladies went to see
(according <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>to Horace Walpole), also lived on this spot.&nbsp; Its
secure condition for persons of this description may be imagined,
when it is recollected that there was, previous to 1768, no
direct road to this part.&nbsp; The only way was from Chelsea;
the road through Belgrave Place was not fit for carriages till
this time.&nbsp; It was then completed and carried on to the
Stonebridge, a bridge over the Westbourne, by the end of
Wilderness Row.&nbsp; Parties going to Ranelagh by coach went
along the King&rsquo;s Road, a roadway to the left leading to the
Grove; but in that day the silent highway of the Thames was much
used, and as the ballad tells, the &ldquo;fine city ladies&rdquo;
delighted in a voyage to Ranelagh or Vauxhall.</p>
<p>The Grosvenor Canal, which forms the boundary of our district
on one side, was formed in 1823; its head had been the property
of the Chelsea Waterworks Company, who in that year removed their
works to their late position at Ranelagh.&nbsp; The canal enters
the Thames a few yards eastward of the new Pimlico Bridge, the

<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>At
the foot, where the Pimlico Bridge now stands, was the
&ldquo;White House,&rdquo; a lonely habitation by the river side,
used once by anglers; opposite to which, on the Surrey side,
stood the &ldquo;Red House,&rdquo; a still more noted place of
resort.&nbsp; Fifty yards westward of this spot, according to
Maitland, C&aelig;sar crossed the Thames, on his second
expedition into Britain; but the opinion of Maitland is not
generally shared in by antiquaries, who, notwithstanding the
arguments advanced by different writers, in favour of spots they
themselves have fixed on, yet in general adhere to the opinion of
the father of English antiquaries, and agree with Camden, that
this passage of the Thames was at Coway Stakes.&nbsp;
Nevertheless it must be borne in mind, that many relics of this
period have been found in the bed of the Thames at and about this
spot; and during the progress of the bridge, coins and relics of
a later time, many of which were Roman, were also discovered.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Barnabas&rsquo; College</span>
consists of a Church, a Residentiary-house for the Clergy
attached thereto, and a School-house, with residence for the
teachers.&nbsp; The design originated with the <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Rev. W. J.
E. Bennett, and the ground was the gift of the Marquis of
Westminster.&nbsp; The commencement of the work was with the
School-house, the foundation-stone of which was laid June 11th,
1846 (St. Barnabas&rsquo; Day); the foundation-stone of the
Church was laid twelve months later, on which occasion the new
School-house was formally opened; and on St. Barnabas&rsquo; Day,
1850, the Church was consecrated by the late Bishop of
London.</p>
<p>The architecture, chosen by Mr. Cundy, under whose
superintendence the College was erected, is the Early
Pointed.&nbsp; The Church has a tower and spire of Caen stone,
containing ten bells, the gift of as many parishioners; it is 170
ft. high.&nbsp; The interior is of great splendour, the open roof
being finely painted, and the windows throughout of stained
glass, by Wailes, of Newcastle, and representing incidents of the
life of St. Barnabas.&nbsp; The chancel is separated from the
body of the Church by a carved oak screen; the other wood
fittings are also of oak.&nbsp; The lectern (a brass eagle), the
communion-plate, font, and other costly ornaments, were the gifts
of private individuals.</p>
<p>The Church has sittings for about 1,000 persons, <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>all of
which are free.&nbsp; It was erected entirely by voluntary
contributions, and under the energetic incumbency of Mr.
Bennett.&nbsp; Its cost has been about &pound;15,000, of which
the expense of the carcase of the Church, vestries, and buildings
attached, amounted to &pound;10,232.</p>
<p>St. Barnabas is but a Chapel-of-Ease to St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
is under the same legal government.&nbsp; Churchwardens are,
however, appointed by the Incumbent of St. Paul&rsquo;s for the
maintenance of order and other similar offices; but, in other
respects, the usual legal duties devolve on the wardens of St.
Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Schools are designed for 600
children&mdash;200 each of boys, girls, and infants.</p>
<p>During the Anti-Papal agitation of 1850, this Church was more
than once the scene of unseemly disturbances on the part of the
mob, and, to suppress which, it was necessary to call in the aid
of the police.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Avery Farm Row</span> doubtless is a
remnant in name of some rural time.&nbsp; A family named Avery
frequently appear in the registers of Knightsbridge Chapel, from
1663 to 1691; the probability is they were farmers here.&nbsp;
Another Avery Row runs parallel to Bond Street.</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span><span
class="smcap">Blomfield Terrace</span> was so named after the
late Bishop of London.&nbsp; At No. 1, the late Captain Warner,
so well known for his <i>invention</i> of the &ldquo;long
range,&rdquo; died in December 5th, 1853.&nbsp; He had long
resided in the locality, and was well known in it.&nbsp; He left
seven children with their mother, in great distress, for whom the
Hon. and Rev. Robert Liddell made a public appeal; but it
afterwards transpired his wife was living in receipt of parochial
relief at Ashford.&nbsp; Warner was buried in the West Brompton
Cemetery.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Commercial Road</span> (The), on the
right-hand side of the canal, is occupied almost entirely by
factories, workshops, and the dwellings of those employed
therein.&nbsp; A &ldquo;House of Refuge,&rdquo; under the
management of the clergy of the parish, is situated here; and
also a Ragged School, both supported by public contributions.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s Whim Bridge, sometime called the Wooden, and now
Ebury Bridge, crosses the canal at the north end of the
Commercial Road.&nbsp; Here was a turnpike, similarly named, till
1825.&nbsp; Jenny&rsquo;s Whim was a very celebrated place of
amusement, on the site of St. <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>George&rsquo;s Row.&nbsp; It was
equally the resort of high and low, and with all classes was for
a lengthened period a favourite place of recreation.&nbsp; I
never could unearth the origin of the name, but presume the
tradition told me by an old inhabitant was the correct account,
viz., that it was so called from its first landlady, who caused
the gardens to be laid out in so fantastic a manner, as to cause
the expressive little noun to be affixed to the pretty and
familiar christian name she bore.&nbsp; Angelo says it was
established by a celebrated pyrotechnist in the reign of George
I.&nbsp; The house had a large breakfast room, and the grounds,
though not large, contained a bowling green, alcoves, arbours,
and flower beds, with a fish pond in the centre.&nbsp; There was
also a cock-pit; and in a pond adjacent the brutal sport of
duck-hunting was carried on.&nbsp; This is alluded to in the
following sketch, quoted from the <i>Connoisseur</i>, May 15,
1775:&mdash;&ldquo;The lower sort of people have their Ranelaghs
and their Vauxhalls as well as the quality.&nbsp; Perrot&rsquo;s
inimitable grotto may be seen, for only calling for a pint of
beer; and the royal diversion of duck-hunting may be had into the
bargain, together with a decanter <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>of Dorchester, for your sixpence, at
Jenny&rsquo;s Whim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo says:&mdash;&ldquo;It was much frequented, from its
novelty being an inducement to allure the curious, by its amusing
deceptions.&nbsp; Here was a large garden; in different parts
were recesses, and by treading on a spring&mdash;taking you by
surprise&mdash;up started different figures, some ugly enough to
frighten you&mdash;a harlequin, a Mother Shipton, or some
terrific animal.&nbsp; In a large piece of water facing the tea
alcoves, large fish or mermaids were showing themselves above the
surface.&rdquo;&nbsp; Horace Walpole, in his Letters,
occasionally alludes to Jenny&rsquo;s Whim; in one to Montagu he
spitefully says&mdash;&ldquo;Here (at Vauxhall) we picked up Lord
Granby, arrived very drunk from Jenny&rsquo;s Whim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Towards the close of the last century, Jenny&rsquo;s Whim
began to decline; its morning visitors were not so numerous, and
opposition was also powerful.&nbsp; It gradually became
forgotten, and at last sunk to the condition of a beer-house, and
about 1804 the business altogether ceased.</p>
<p>Jenny&rsquo;s Whim has more than once served the novelist for
an illustration; see &ldquo;Maids of <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>Honour; a Tale of the Times of
George the First:&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There were gardens,&rdquo;
says the writer, mentioning the place, &ldquo;attached to it, and
a bowling green; and parties were frequently made, composed of
ladies and gentlemen, to enjoy a day&rsquo;s amusement there in
eating strawberries and cream, syllabubs, cake, and taking other
refreshments, of which a great variety could be procured, with
cider, perry, ale, wine, and other liquors in abundance.&nbsp;
The gentlemen played at bowls&mdash;some employed themselves at
skittles; whilst the ladies amused themselves at a swing, or
walked about the garden, admiring the sunflowers, hollyhocks, the
Duke of Malborough cut out of a filbert tree, and the roses and
daisies, currants and gooseberries, that spread their alluring
charms in every path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was a favourite rendezvous for lovers in courting
time&mdash;a day&rsquo;s pleasure at Jenny&rsquo;s Whim being
considered by the fair one the most enticing enjoyment that could
be offered her; and often the hearts of the most obdurate have
given way beneath the influence of its attractions.&nbsp;
Jenny&rsquo;s Whim, therefore, had always, during the season,
plenty of pleasant <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>parties of young people of both sexes.&nbsp; Sometimes
all its chambers were filled, and its gardens thronged by gay and
sentimental visitors.&rdquo; <a name="citation257"></a><a

<p>The house is still partly standing, and by its red brick and
lattice-work may be easily identified.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Graham Street</span>.&mdash;In this street
lived and died a man for many years well known in London, James
Thornton.&nbsp; He was <i>cook</i> to the Duke of Wellington
throughout the Peninsular and Waterloo campaigns.&nbsp; When, on
the death of his great master, it was stated in the papers that
the Duke&rsquo;s dinner on the eventful 18th of June was dressed
by a Frenchman, he indignantly wrote to the <i>Times</i>,
claiming his honour.&nbsp; He possessed an unlimited fund of
anecdote, and used to boast he buried Lord Anglesea&rsquo;s leg,
and helped to support Raglan at the amputation of his arm.&nbsp;
Thornton died in 1853.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Grosvenor Row</span>, together with Queen
Street and Jews&rsquo; Row, form one thoroughfare.&nbsp; It <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>formerly
was one of the most remarkable streets in or around the
metropolis, and, to a great extent, is so now.&nbsp; To Jews Row
came Wilkie to sketch his &ldquo;Chelsea Pensioner reading the
Account of the Battle of Waterloo,&rdquo; painted for the Duke of
Wellington.&nbsp; The iron gate shown in the picture is still to
be seen.&nbsp; The numerous signs bear witness to the military
air of the neighbourhood, such as &ldquo;The Snow Shoes,&rdquo; a
recollection of Wolfe&rsquo;s glorious campaign, the
&ldquo;General Elliott,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Duke of
York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grosvenor Row, which terminates at the Stone Bridge (as the
place is marked in old plans), was built in 1768.&nbsp; At the
end is the &ldquo;Nell Gwynn,&rdquo; a tavern named after the
mistress of Charles II.&nbsp; Its sign-board was originally
decorated with her likeness; and the legend, firmly believed by
old Chelsea folk, that to her the noble institution adjacent owes
its foundation, was painted underneath.&nbsp; Nell&rsquo;s
residence at Sandy End has been doubted by Mr. Cunningham.&nbsp;
It is certain that her mother resided near the Neate Houses in
Pimlico; and, in the records of Knightsbridge Chapel, there are
occasionally entries of the <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>name&mdash;connections not
improbably of the royal mistress.&nbsp; One of the entries, Jan.
13, 1667, records the marriage of Robert Hands and Mary Gwin, the
former being the name of a family long resident freeholders in
Pimlico, and to whom Chelsea Bun House, which I am now about to
notice, belonged.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chelsea Bun House</span> was established
early in the eighteenth century, but the exact time is
unknown.&nbsp; It had obtained a reputation for its buns as early
as 1712; for in that year, Swift, who then resided at Chelsea,
mentions buying one of them in his walks.&nbsp; It soon became
quite a fashionable resort of a morning: even the Royal Family
used familiarly to visit Mrs. Hands, who was a complete living
history of all the affairs of the district, and of those who came
thither.&nbsp; To her customers her garrulous anecdote was a fund
of amusement, and her house and colonnade were continually
crowded with loungers.&nbsp; George II., his Queen, and their
family, patronised the place, and were frequently to be seen
laying siege to its delicacies.&nbsp; George III., too, after he
had ascended the throne, did not forget the spot where, in his
childhood, he had paid many a pleasant <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>visit; and
in his turn, when his family was young, he and Queen Charlotte
frequently accompanied it thither.&nbsp; The latter presented
Mrs. Hands with a silver half-gallon mug, highly ornamented, and
five guineas at its bottom, as a testimony of her appreciation of
the attentions bestowed on the royal children.</p>
<p>On Good Fridays the concourse of people drawn hither was
immense.&nbsp; Business on this day was always commenced at four
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, by which time numbers of customers
were waiting; and on some occasions it has been estimated that
fifty thousand persons have assembled here for hours before eight
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Occasionally the crowd became unruly, and
disturbances ensued, and it was found necessary to close the
establishment partially.&nbsp; Handbills of a warning character
were issued, and constables stationed to preserve order.</p>
<p>When Ranelagh declined from its zenith, the Bun House
experienced the reverse of fortune.&nbsp; Parties visiting the
former generally called to patronise the latter before they
entered; and the success of the one depended more perhaps than
would have been easily <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>credited on that of the other, and
it gradually dwindled away to complete insignificance.</p>
<p>The Bun House consisted of but one storey, was about 50 ft. in
length by 14 ft. in breadth, with a colonnade in front projecting
over the pavement, and affording a convenient shelter in wet
weather.&nbsp; The interior was fitted up in a perfectly unique
manner; the array of curiosities of every kind, and various
countries, forming a collection amusing and grotesque.&nbsp;
There were artificial and natural curiosities, the former
including models of St. Mary Redcliffe, and of a ship; clocks of
curious devices, and a model on horseback of the Duke of
Cumberland, in the costume worn at Culloden; two grenadiers in
the costume of the same period, four feet in height, in lead, and
weighing each nearly two hundredweight.&nbsp; There were also
some paintings, the most famous of which was the portrait of
Aurungzebe, Emperor of Hindostan.&nbsp; The natural curiosities
consisted of stuffed birds and animals, minerals, ores, and
similar rarities, arranged in cases; while the furniture, antique
in manufacture, multifarious in design, strong in make, and
comfortable in use, added to the peculiarity of <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>the place,
and its attractions.&nbsp; In the King&rsquo;s collection in the
British Museum is an engraving of &ldquo;A Perspective View of
Richard Hands&rsquo; Bun House, at Chelsea, who has the Honour to
serve the Royal Family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Various improvements being carried out in this part of
Pimlico, in accordance with an Act of Parliament (introduced by
Sir Matthew Wood), passed in 1839, the Bun House was condemned
and pulled down in that year; preserving its ancient appearance,
though not its ancient reputation, to the last.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Hands died, her son carried on the business.&nbsp;
He was a most eccentric character, and dealt also largely in
butter, which in all weathers he carried about the streets in a
basket.&nbsp; He, like his mother, was thoroughly versed in the
lore of the district, and like the old Bluegown in Scott&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Antiquary,&rdquo; was the bearer of its news as well as
butter.&nbsp; He was much respected in the neighbourhood; and on
his death, an elder brother, who had entered the army, and was
then a poor knight of Windsor, became proprietor.&nbsp; He also
was eccentric in manner, and peculiar in costume; and on his
death, leaving no friends or <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>relatives, the property was claimed
by the Crown.</p>
<p>Chelsea Bun, House has given name to one of Miss
Manning&rsquo;s novels, published in 1854.</p>
<p>Opposite to the Bun House stood Stromboli House and gardens, a
minor place of recreation, at its height about 1788; on the site
of St. Barnabas&rsquo; College stood the Orange tavern and
tea-gardens.&nbsp; Here was a private theatre, at which the local
genii of the sock and buskin performed to their admiring
neighbours; and at the junction of Grosvenor Row and Ebury Street
stood an old inn, a relic of the Republicans in the
neighbourhood, and which bore one of the peculiar and
enthusiastic appellations of that period&mdash;<i>God
encompasseth us</i>.&nbsp; This was corrupted into &ldquo;The
Goat and Compasses,&rdquo; an absurd and unmeaning sign, but the
modern inn is now called simply &ldquo;The Compasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Ranelagh Grove and Terrace</span> is so
named from the celebrated place of amusement of our ancestors;
but is in the parish of Chelsea, and therefore not within our
design.&nbsp; At No. 2, Ranelagh Terrace, died the Rev. Thomas
Pennington, nephew of the celebrated Elizabeth <a
name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>Carter.&nbsp; He was author of two works of foreign
travel, and also of &ldquo;Memoirs of the Grand Dukes of the
House of Medici.&rdquo;&nbsp; He died December 21st, 1852, in his
92nd year.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Upper Ebury Street</span>.&mdash;Part only
of this street is within the district of St. Paul&rsquo;s; in it
died Rodwell, the composer, and William Skelton, a celebrated
engraver.&nbsp; Skelton&rsquo;s productions are numerous, and
extend over a lengthened period, among them a series of portraits
of the reigning family from George III. to our present
Queen.&nbsp; He died here, August 13th, 1848, in his 86th year,
and was buried in Brompton Cemetery.</p>
<p>Several places of public entertainment were in the
neighbourhood of Ebury Street, the chief of which were &ldquo;The
Star and Garter&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dwarf;&rdquo; both were in
their heyday about 1760; and notices of them were frequent in the
papers of the time.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Cherokee Chiefs,&rdquo;
objects of wonder in 1760, and alluded to in Goldsmith&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Citizen of the World,&rdquo; were frequently to be seen
here.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Star and Garter&rdquo; stood near to the
end of Burton Street, &ldquo;The Dwarf&rdquo; on the site of the
factory in Elizabeth Street.&nbsp; There were besides <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>these,
places of minor resort, mere tea-gardens.&nbsp; &ldquo;To drink
tea at Pimlico&rdquo; became proverbial in the last
century.&nbsp; Here came from the close streets, to inhale the
purer air of the fields, hundreds of the working-classes; more
especially on the Sunday they poured forth, old and young,
married and single.&nbsp; Gay says of the spring-time&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then Chelsea&rsquo;s meads o&rsquo;erhear
perfidious vows,<br />
And the press&rsquo;d grass defrauds the grazing cows.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of these places was attached to the house now numbered
75.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Westbourne Place</span> is a neat double
row of houses (deriving its name from the stream) joining Eaton
and Sloane Squares.&nbsp; No. 2 was the house taken in 1808 by
Colonel Wardle for the notorious Mary Ann Clarke, as part
recompense for the services she was to render in the prosecution
of the inquiry into the conduct of the Duke of York.&nbsp; Into
the history of this disgraceful connection I do not intend to
enter, any more than to say, that afterwards an action was
brought against Colonel Wardle for the value of the furniture
supplied to this house, as was alleged, on the faith of his
personal promise.&nbsp; William Thomas Lewis, for many <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>years a
popular comedian, and acting manager of Covent Garden Theatre,
died at his residence in Westbourne Place on January 13th,
1811.&nbsp; No. 23 was once the residence of Miss Corbaux,
celebrated as a painter, and for her knowledge in those most
recondite of studies, the histories and languages of the ancient
nations of the East.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Westbourne Street</span> branches off
Westbourne Place.&nbsp; Mr. Smith, author of &ldquo;A History of
Marylebone,&rdquo; once lived here.&nbsp; In this street is a
Baptist Chapel.&nbsp; Formerly, on a part of this ground, was
York Hospital, a dep&ocirc;t for invalid soldiers, and named
after the Duke of York.&nbsp; Here for two years, <i>without
pay</i>, Mr. Guthrie, the eminent surgeon, attended on the poor
fellows maimed at Waterloo.&nbsp; The establishment, in 1819, was
removed to Chatham.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> with the previous chapter
brought my account of Knightsbridge to a close, I cannot more
appropriately conclude than by a few remarks on subjects coming
within the scope of the heading of this chapter.&nbsp; But here
again my notes must necessarily be meagre and brief, for
Knightsbridge never having been of itself parochial, books, such
as generally form the staple of such chapters as this, have never
been kept to show, with the accuracy parish books do, the rise
and progress of the place.</p>
<p>The population of the parish of St. George, <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Hanover
Square, was, according to the census of 1851, 73,230 persons, of
whom 40,034 were within the two wards of Knightsbridge and
Pimlico; and of this number, about 14,000 are resident in the
district of St. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The population of All
Saints&rsquo; district cannot with accuracy be tested, a large
part of it lying beyond our bounds; and building having made very
extensive progress even since 1851, its population has increased
in proportion.</p>
<p>In 1578, Mr. Walcot states only six persons were rated by the
St. Margaret&rsquo;s overseers in Knightsbridge and Kensington;
and in 1687 only five people are rated in St. Martin&rsquo;s
books for the whole of Pimlico.</p>
<p>The progress of building appears to have taken place not so
much progressively as in two distinct movements.&nbsp; The first
was from 1770 to 1780, and the other from 1825 to our own time;
on examination, it will be found that few of our streets were
built at other periods.&nbsp; A letter before me of a skilled
carpenter, written in 1783, tells his friends in the country he
gets 2s. 8d. per day for his labour, and that he is allowed to
make seven days per week, &ldquo;and if the peace
continueth&rdquo; he shall be able to <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>realise 20s. or a guinea per week;
for his lodging he paid 2s. per week.&nbsp; If this was a fair
sample of the rate of wages then, the mechanic&rsquo;s financial
condition must have improved to an extent little credited perhaps
by themselves.</p>
<p>The air of Knightsbridge has always been considered pure and
salubrious.&nbsp; Swift brought Harrison to the place for the
benefit of pure air; and fifty years since it still maintained
the character, for Lady Hester Stanhope sent a faithful footman
here for the same relief.&nbsp; Constitution Hill and Montpelier
Square derived their names from this fact.&nbsp; The main street
of Knightsbridge, from Hyde Park Corner to Kensington, stands on
a peculiar but well-defined terrace of the London clay, which
separates the gravels of Hyde Park from those more southward, <a
name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269"
class="citation">[269]</a> and is rather more than thirty feet
deep.&nbsp; The yellow gravel of Hyde Park, says Sir Charles
Lyell, is, comparatively speaking, of modern date, consisting of
slightly rolled angular fragments, in which portions of the white
opaque coating of the original chalk-flint remain
uncovered.&nbsp; Southward of the clayey line <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>just
mentioned the surface soil is a &ldquo;made&rdquo; one.&nbsp;
Underneath the native earth are thick layers of sand, beneath
which is a blue clayey earth, and then a sediment, consisting
chiefly of cockle and oyster shells, which beautifully retain
their appearance.&nbsp; Thus the soil of our locality is a porous
one, and rapidly absorbs the surface water; an advantage greatly
tending to the health of the inhabitants, for parts of Pimlico
are but slightly above high-water mark, and the air would
consequently be very moist and relaxing.</p>
<p>In a sanitary point of view all is not fair, even in
Belgravia; behind its imposing mansions many a foul spot is
hypocritically hidden; and although much has been done by the
medical officer, there yet remains plenty of work on hand for
him: too many spots yet requiring thorough transformation, and a
vigilant watch to be kept, that selfishness be not permitted to
triumph over public good. <a name="citation270"></a><a
href="#footnote270" class="citation">[270]</a></p>
<p>The local government of part of Knightsbridge and Belgravia
was formerly undertaken by a Board of Trustees chosen by
authority of <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>an Act of Parliament passed in 1829.&nbsp; This was one
of the local measures swept away by the general Act of Sir B.
Hall; and now the Knightsbridge ward (extending to Ebury Street)
returns twenty-seven members to the vestry of St. George, as
constituted by his bill.&nbsp; The other parts of the hamlet were
under control from various bodies deriving authority under
several Acts of Parliament, but now belong to wards of the
parishes in which they are situated.&nbsp; The bill passed by Sir
B. Hall, though perhaps not all that could be desired, is yet
calculated to effect an immense improvement over the old system,
which in this locality, conflicting with other interests and
regulations, worked but poorly.&nbsp; Many of the improvements
and alterations, appearing in themselves to be but trifling, yet,
when looked at in the aggregate, are of great benefit and
importance, were effected by the energy of individuals instead of
the action of the local board.&nbsp; One instance will
suffice.&nbsp; The footway between the Spring Gate and Hyde Park
Corner remained a gravel walk, which in winter time became mere
slush, until some of the inhabitants at length caused the
Government to pave it in 1854; and even <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>the
&ldquo;crossing&rdquo; from the Spring Gate to St. George&rsquo;s
Place was paid for by Mr. Westerton and one or two other
inhabitants.</p>
<p>In politics, in the days of Burdett, the Knightsbridgites were
generally Radicals of the first water.&nbsp; Burdett was in every
respect their man.&nbsp; He and Hobhouse once started on their
&ldquo;chairing&rdquo; from the house at the corner of Sloane
Street.</p>
<p>The right of voting for representatives is not the only
privilege the inhabitants of the hamlet enjoy.&nbsp; Those who
are in the All Saints District are qualified for all the numerous
hospitals and charities in the parish of St. Margaret&rsquo;s,
which are among the best and most liberal in the metropolis.</p>
<p>The Government having decided on erecting at the
&ldquo;Gore&rdquo; museums and galleries for our National
Collections, it is only reasonable to believe that such will
result in a thorough revolution in the locality.&nbsp; Such has
already taken place at the Gore and Brompton, and it behoves
those who have the local management in their hands to render the
neighbourhood a fit one for such establishments.&nbsp; The
improvement of its approaches should, above all things, <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>be
considered; and in the main street of our hamlet there is yet,
unluckily, too much room for improvement.&nbsp; It would be a
worthy entrance to the capital of the kingdom, if the many
abominations now offending the eye could be removed; and it is
doubtful if there is any valid reason for not setting to at the
work right earnestly.&nbsp; If the Park could be thrown open all
the way from Apsley House to the Chapel (for it is hopeless to
expect the removal of the vulgar monsters at Albert Gate), and
again continued to include the Barracks, such would render the
roadway the most beautiful and fine in every way; would add to
its healthiness by allowing the free air to circulate, and
ultimately prove to be of the most lasting benefit to the
community.&nbsp; But if in course of time the present buildings
are but to make way for others, it will not only perpetuate a
nuisance, but a disgrace. <a name="citation273"></a><a

<h3>APPENDIX I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">KNIGHTSBRIDGE A FAMILY NAME.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Issue Roll of the Exchequer,
edited by Frederick Devon, are several payments in the 43rd Henry
III. to Henry de Knythebrig, Nicholas de Eye, and others,
carpenters employed at the King&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp; A Richard
Knightsbridge was rector of Sheatham in 1640; and the name,
though rarely, may still occasionally be met with.</p>
<h3>APPENDIX II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE CROMWELL TRADITION.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Until</span> the year 1853 there stood a
curious and lonely mansion in the Brompton Lanes known as
Cromwell House.&nbsp; The original name was Hale House, but it
was never called by it within the memory of any now living.&nbsp;
There are one or two versions of the story attached to this old
house printed; but they do not entirely agree with that which I
have always heard&mdash;to the effect, that on some occasion
Cromwell&rsquo;s troop was quartered at Knightsbridge; and he one
day venturing to stray among the lanes of Brompton, was met by
some cavaliers who knew him, and pursued him to this house, where
he was sheltered till assistance arrived from Knightsbridge and
liberated him.&nbsp; And a confirmation was presumed to exist in
the inscription on the inn&rsquo;s front at Knightsbridge that
Oliver&rsquo;s bodyguard <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>was once quartered there, and that
it was once his &ldquo;posting-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am perfectly aware that almost every village has its
Cromwellian legend, and also that every endeavour to connect the
Protector and this mansion has hitherto failed.&nbsp; But I own I
am by no means inclined to throw over the pleasing belief
entirely.&nbsp; There is a charity at Kensington still, called
Cromwell&rsquo;s Gift, which always has been ascribed by parish
officers and inhabitants to the generosity of the great ruler;
and although this is unaccountably not entered in the parish
books, I do not consider such an omission a reason for
disbelieving the history handed down by successive generations of
parish officers, and still to be read in the church porch.&nbsp;
In true earnest, I think the omission favourable to my
view.&nbsp; No other origin has ever been assigned to the
charity; and the church authorities at the Restoration would
scarcely have permitted a laudatory inscription to the Protector
to remain.&nbsp; There are no other claimants, and never were:
the tradition is, and always has been, that to Oliver Cromwell
Kensington is indebted for this charity, and to him alone.</p>
<p>What reason, then, for this remembrance?&nbsp; The old legend
of Cromwell House, is the answer.&nbsp; We know the Parliament
forces were frequently quartered here.&nbsp; Through
Knightsbridge ran the high-road from Oxford; and Cavaliers
proceeding thence would most probably take the bye-road as they
neared the metropolis.&nbsp; And the idea is surely not an
improbable one that Cromwell may have been met with in the manner
related.</p>
<p>So far for the legend; but apart from this is another
consideration.&nbsp; In 1668, the Lawrences of Shurdington, in
Gloucestershire, rented Cromwell House of the Methwolds.&nbsp; <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>Henry
Lawrence was President of Cromwell&rsquo;s Privy Council, and in
other ways a staunch adherent of his policy.&nbsp; If it could be
proved he resided here at any time during his official career, a
new light would be thrown on the subject, and probably clear it
up.&nbsp; On the whole, therefore, I consider there are grounds,
though they may be but slight, for not entirely discarding the
tradition, which may yet be some day entirely unravelled.</p>
<h3>APPENDIX III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ACT FOR BUILDING ALBERT GATE.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Act of Parliament which
authorised the improvement at Albert Gate may prove hereafter to
be one greatly affecting the inhabitants of the hamlet and the
frequenters of the Park, the clause relating to Knightsbridge is
here appended.</p>
<p>The Bill passed May 10th, 1841, and received the Royal Assent
a short time following:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anno Quarto Victori&aelig; Regin&aelig;, Chapter
XII.&nbsp; An Act to enable Her Majesty&rsquo;s Commissioners of
Woods to make a new Street from Coventry Street, Piccadilly, to
Long Acre, and for other Improvements in the
Metropolis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clause LXXVII.&mdash;And whereas it is in contemplation by the
Commissioners of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Woods, Forests, Land
Revenues, Works, and Buildings, to recommend to Her Majesty, with
a view to public Improvement and the Accommodation of the
Inhabitants of the new Squares, Streets, and Places, that have
lately been erected and formed in the neighbourhood of
Knightsbridge, in the County of Middlesex, to make a new
Thoroughfare and Opening into Hyde Park, subject to such
Regulations as Her Majesty may approve of: And whereas the Dean
and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter Westminster
<a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>are the
Owners of certain Ground and Houses on the North Side of the
Knightsbridge Road, and immediately adjoining that part of Hyde
Park where the intended Opening is proposed to be made, and it is
essential to the Accomplishment of the projected Improvements
that the said Dean and Chapter should have Power to sell, or to
lease for any Term not exceeding ninety-nine Years, to the said
Commissioners of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Woods, Forests, Land
Revenues, Works, and Buildings, certain small Portions of such
Ground and Houses, for the Purpose of enabling the said
Commissioners to make the said intended Opening, and to erect
Houses of a suitable Class and Elevation on each Side thereof, be
it enacted, That it shall be lawful for the said Dean and Chapter
of the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter Westminster, and they are
hereby authorised and empowered to contract for, Sell, and convey
to Her Majesty, Her Heirs and Successors, at such Price or Prices
as shall be agreed upon, or ascertained in manner prescribed by
the Act hereinafter referred to, to be the fair value thereof,
all or any Part of the Ground and Hereditaments hereinafter
described, that is to say, all that Piece or Parcel of Ground,
with the Cannon Brewery, the Fox and Bull Public House, and other
Buildings, thereon erected and built, situate on the North Side
of the Knightsbridge Road aforesaid, bounded on the East by the
Watercourse leading from and out of the Serpentine River to the
River Thames, and extending Westward from such Watercourse Two
hundred and thirty Feet or thereabouts on the North and South
Sides thereof, and containing in Breadth one hundred and thirty
Feet or thereabouts on the West Side thereof, and One hundred
Feet or thereabouts on the East Side thereof; and also all that
other Piece or Parcel of Ground, with the several Messuages <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>and
Buildings thereon erected and built, known and distinguished by
the Nos. 23, 24, and 25, Knightsbridge, bounded on the West by
the said Watercourse, and extending Eastwards therefrom
Seventy-four Feet or thereabouts on the North and South Sides
thereof, and containing in Breadth Eighty-four Feet or
thereabouts on the West Side thereof, and Seventy Feet or
thereabouts on the East Side thereof, with the Appurtenances; and
that it shall be lawful for the said Dean and Chapter, and they
are hereby authorised and empowered, by Indenture under their
Common Seal, on the Surrender of any existing Lease or Leases of
the same Premises, or any Part or Parts thereof, to the said
Commissioners, or to such Person or Persons as the said
Commissioners shall appoint on behalf of Her Majesty, Her Heirs
and Successors, for any Term or Number of Years not exceeding
Ninety-nine Years, at such Rent, and subject to such Covenants,
Conditions, and Provisoes, and on such Terms as shall be agreed
upon between the said Dean and Chapter and the said
Commissioners, and to enter into such Contracts and Agreements
for the Purposes aforesaid as to them shall seem proper; and all
Contracts, Agreements, Sales, Leases, Conveyances, and
Assurances, shall be valid and effectual in the Law to all
Intents and Purposes whatsover.</p>
<h3>APPENDIX IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TRINITY CHAPEL, MEMORIAL WINDOWS OF
ST.&nbsp; PAUL&rsquo;S CHURCH, AND ST.&nbsp; PAUL&rsquo;S
SCHOOLS.</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following brief notices are
considered worthy of addition to the work.&nbsp; In the first
place, the days of the Old Chapel, with its present undignified
appearance and circumscribed circle of usefulness, are
numbered.&nbsp; It is <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>purposed, so soon as Dr. Wilson can
procure the necessary funds, some &pound;3,000, to pull down the
present ruinous edifice, and erect a structure in its stead more
worthy of the present position of Knightsbridge.&nbsp; Seventy
years ago it was a poor rural hamlet: it is now a wealthy
populous district.&nbsp; Shall its oldest institution not keep
pace with the locality?&nbsp; May it not yet remain &ldquo;the
Nursing Mother&rdquo; of its natural and legitimate
district?&nbsp; It is trusted that the authorities in such
matters may apportion it an ecclesiastical district, and thus at
last repair the blunder perpetrated at the various parochial
divisions to which our neighbourhood has been subjected.&nbsp; It
may be argued that this new arrangement is unnecessary; but to an
observer it will have appeared that when in our metropolitan
districts new churches have been built, they have been filled,
and work has been found for their clergy without at all lessening
the congregation or otherwise disturbing to injury the
constitution of the parent parish.&nbsp; We anticipate a similar
result: the present chapel is not nearly large enough for its
congregation; and one has only to visit St. Paul&rsquo;s to see
that more space is wanted there.&nbsp; &ldquo;Division of work
makes light labour;&rdquo; with what greater force will that
apply in spiritual matters.&nbsp; We hope that the history of
this old and useful foundation recorded in this work may so
interest the public that they will at once so add to the
&pound;2,000 collected by Dr. Wilson as to enable him to carry
his praiseworthy design into effect immediately.</p>
<p>The next point is, to the memorial windows of the Church,
mentioned at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page96">96</a></span>, have been added the following, in
memory of the persons here named, one to each:&mdash;George
Canning Backhouse, Esq.; Sir Joseph Bailey, Bart.; Arthur Stert,
Esq.; Major-General J. Bucknall Estcourt, Adjutant-General to the
Crimean Army; Captain the Hon. Robert <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>Hay Drummond, Coldstream Guards,
wounded in the trenches before Sebastopol; Lieutenant Hubert
Greville, Coldstream Guards, killed 5th November, 1854;
Brigadier-General Arthur Wellesley Torrens, K.C.B.; and Captain
Viscount Chewton, Scots Fusiliers.&nbsp; On the whole, the list
of those for whom these are memorials is one of which those
connected with the Church may well be proud&mdash;monuments alike
to the illustrious dead and the pious regard of their
survivors.</p>
<p>The third and last addition is relating to the Schools.&nbsp;
They will now, in the course of this year (1859), be at length
housed in buildings fit and proper for the purpose.&nbsp; Since
the original foundation in 1783, this has never been the
case.&nbsp; The new buildings are of a very tasteful design, in
the Early English style.&nbsp; They are built of white Suffolk
bricks, in the form of a cross, with ornamental red brickwork and
Bath-stone windows and dressings.&nbsp; They will have
accommodation for 400 children, although the average attendance
does not exceed, of boys 120, girls 70, infants 90; but
occasionally the numbers are many more, as from their position
(that part of town being half empty greater part of the year) the
attendance is necessarily fluctuating: they are entirely
supported by voluntary contributions and the school-pence.&nbsp;
The education given is on the national system; and if we may
judge from the number of young persons who, having risen to
respectable positions in life, come occasionally to visit their
late instructors, it is not unfruitful of good results.&nbsp; The
estimated cost of the present edifice is &pound;3,000.&nbsp; The
requisite residences of the teachers will be attached thereto so
soon as the subscriptions will allow.&nbsp; The remainder of
their history is told on the parchment enclosed in the
foundation-stone, thus:&mdash;&ldquo;To the glory of God and the
welfare of Christ&rsquo;s poor in <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>the communion of his Church in
England, these parochial Schools of St. Paul&rsquo;s,
Wilton-place, Knightsbridge, are devoted.&nbsp; The first stone
was laid on St. Matthias&rsquo; day, in the year of our Lord
1859, by Henry Barnett, Esq., Treasurer of the Schools; Robert
Liddell, Parish Priest; Thomas Cundy, Architect; George Trollope,
Builder.&rdquo;</p>

Bishops of London with the Christian name of William, about the
time of any eminence that the Chapel enjoyed, this must have been
one of those two, William Laud or William Juxon; seeing that Laud
licensed its rebuilding, and that his chancellor was so far
interested in it as to give the Paten, I think it may be safely
assumed that the small chalice was presented by the former.&nbsp;
Laud was bishop from 1628 to 1633, when he was translated to
Canterbury, and afterwards beheaded.&nbsp; Juxon succeeded him in
the See of London, 1633 until 1660; he was the prelate present

were 394 marriages, two years after the number fell to 155; in

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
